10.1371/journal.pntd.0006301",2021-07-27,[],"Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a debilitating livestock disease prevalent across sub-Saharan Africa, a main cause of which is the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma congolense. In comparison to the well-studied T. brucei, there is a major paucity of knowledge regarding the biology of T. congolense. Here, we use a combination of omics technologies and novel genetic tools to characterise core metabolism in T. congolense mammalian-infective bloodstream-form parasites, and test whether metabolic differences compared to T. brucei impact upon sensitivity to metabolic inhibition. Like the bloodstream stage of T. brucei, glycolysis plays a major part in T. congolense energy metabolism. However, the rate of glucose uptake is significantly lower in bloodstream stage T. congolense, with cells remaining viable when cultured in concentrations as low as 2 mM. Instead of pyruvate, the primary glycolytic endpoints are succinate, malate and acetate. Transcriptomics analysis showed higher levels of transcripts associated with the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, acetate generation, and the glycosomal succinate shunt in T. congolense, compared to T. brucei. Stable-isotope labelling of glucose enabled the comparison of carbon usage between T. brucei and T. congolense, highlighting differences in nucleotide and saturated fatty acid metabolism. To validate the metabolic similarities and differences, both species were treated with metabolic inhibitors, confirming that electron transport chain activity is not essential in T. congolense. However, the parasite exhibits increased sensitivity to inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate import, compared to T. brucei. Strikingly, T. congolense exhibited significant resistance to inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis, including a 780-fold higher EC50 for the lipase and fatty acid synthase inhibitor Orlistat, compared to T. brucei. These data highlight that bloodstream form T. congolense diverges from T. brucei in key areas of metabolism, with several features that are intermediate between bloodstream- and insect-stage T. brucei. These results have implications for drug development, mechanisms of drug resistance and host-pathogen interactions."

UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP), the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, is localized in the cytosol and glycosomes of the bloodstream and procyclic trypanosomes, despite the absence of any known peroxisome-targeting signal (PTS1 and PTS2). The questions that we address here are (i) is the unusual glycosomal biosynthetic pathway of sugar nucleotides functional and (ii) how is the PTS-free UGP imported into glycosomes? We showed that UGP is imported into glycosomes by piggybacking on the glycosomal PTS1-containing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and identified the domains involved in the UGP/PEPCK interaction. Proximity ligation assays revealed that this interaction occurs in 3 to 10% of glycosomes, suggesting that these correspond to organelles competent for protein import. We also showed that UGP is essential for the growth of trypanosomes and that both the glycosomal and cytosolic metabolic pathways involving UGP are functional, since the lethality of the knockdown UGP mutant cell line ("
3,Nutrient availability regulates proline/alanine transporters in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100566,2021-03-23,"['Trypanosoma brucei', 'amino acid', 'amino acid transport', 'cell metabolism', 'energy metabolism', 'gene expression', 'parasite metabolism', 'transcriptomics', 'transporter']","Trypanosoma brucei is a species of unicellular parasite that can cause severe diseases in livestock and humans, including African trypanosomiasis and Chagas disease. Adaptation to diverse environments and changes in nutritional conditions is essential for T. brucei to establish an infection when changing hosts or during invasion of different host tissues. One such adaptation is the ability of T. brucei to rapidly switch its energy metabolism from glucose metabolism in the mammalian blood to proline catabolism in the insect stages and vice versa. However, the mechanisms that support the parasite's response to nutrient availability remain unclear. Using RNAseq and qRT-PCR, we investigated the response of T. brucei to amino acid or glucose starvation and found increased mRNA levels of several amino acid transporters, including all genes of the amino acid transporter AAT7-B subgroup. Functional characterization revealed that AAT7-B members are plasma membrane-localized in T. brucei and when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae supported the uptake of proline, alanine, and cysteine, while other amino acids were poorly recognized. All AAT7-B members showed a preference for proline, which is transported with high or low affinity. RNAi-mediated AAT7-B downregulation resulted in a reduction of intracellular proline concentrations and growth arrest under low proline availability in cultured procyclic form parasites. Taken together, these results suggest a role of AAT7-B transporters in the response of T. brucei to proline starvation and proline catabolism."

Due to difficulties in acquiring enough parasites from the tsetse fly vector, the dynamics of the parasite's metabolic rewiring in the vector have remained obscure. Here, we took advantage of in vitro-induced differentiation to follow changes at the RNA, protein, and metabolite levels. This multi-omics and cell-based profiling showed an immediate redirection of electron flow from the cytochrome-mediated pathway to an alternative oxidase (AOX), an increase in proline consumption, elevated activity of complex II, and certain tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, which led to mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Interestingly, these ROS molecules appear to act as signaling molecules driving developmental progression because ectopic expression of catalase, a ROS scavenger, halted the in vitro-induced differentiation. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of the parasite's mitochondrial rewiring and reinforce the emerging concept that mitochondria act as signaling organelles through release of ROS to drive cellular differentiation."

Indeed, the pathway has long been considered a potential therapeutic target to tackle the devastating and neglected tropical diseases caused by these parasites. However, plasma membrane glucose and glycerol transporters are both expressed by trypanosomes and these parasites can infiltrate tissues that contain glycerol. Here, we show that bloodstream form trypanosomes can use glycerol for gluconeogenesis and for ATP production, particularly when deprived of glucose following hexose transporter depletion. We demonstrate that Trypanosoma brucei hexose transporters 1 and 2 (THT1 and THT2) are localized to the plasma membrane and that knockdown of THT1 expression leads to a growth defect that is more severe when THT2 is also knocked down. These data are consistent with THT1 and THT2 being the primary routes of glucose supply for the production of ATP by glycolysis. However, supplementation of the growth medium with glycerol substantially rescued the growth defect caused by THT1 and THT2 knockdown. Metabolomic analyses with heavy-isotope labelled glycerol demonstrated that trypanosomes take up glycerol and use it to synthesize intermediates of gluconeogenesis, including fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and hexose 6-phosphates, which feed the pentose phosphate pathway and variant surface glycoprotein biosynthesis. We used Cas9-mediated gene knockout to demonstrate a gluconeogenesis-specific, but fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Tb927.9.8720)-independent activity, converting fructose 1,6-bisphosphate into fructose 6-phosphate. In addition, we observed increased flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the succinate shunt. Thus, contrary to prior thinking, gluconeogenesis can operate in bloodstream form T. brucei. This pathway, using glycerol as a physiological substrate, may be required in mammalian host tissues."

Many studies have been conducted on glucose uptake and metabolism, but none thus far have been able to monitor changes in cellular and organellar glucose concentration in live parasites. We have developed a non-destructive technique for monitoring changes in cytosolic and glycosomal glucose levels in T. brucei using a fluorescent protein biosensor (FLII12Pglu-700μδ6) in combination with flow cytometry. T. brucei parasites harboring the biosensor allowed for observation of cytosolic glucose levels. Appending a type 1 peroxisomal targeting sequence caused biosensors to localize to glycosomes, which enabled observation of glycosomal glucose levels. Using this approach, we investigated cytosolic and glycosomal glucose levels in response to changes in external glucose or 2-deoxyglucose concentration. These data show that procyclic form and bloodstream form parasites maintain different glucose concentrations in their cytosol and glycosomes. In procyclic form parasites, the cytosol and glycosomes maintain indistinguishable glucose levels (3.4 ± 0.4mM and 3.4 ± 0.5mM glucose respectively) at a 6.25mM external glucose concentration. In contrast, bloodstream form parasites maintain glycosomal glucose levels that are ~1.8-fold higher than the surrounding cytosol, equating to 1.9 ± 0.6mM in cytosol and 3.5 ± 0.5mM in glycosomes. While the mechanisms of glucose transport operating in the glycosomes of bloodstream form T. brucei remain unresolved, the methods described here will provide a means to begin to dissect the cellular machinery required for subcellular distribution of this critical hexose."

To clarify the mechanisms of DA-resistance in B. gibsoni, we initially examined the intracellular DA content in the DA-resistant isolate using high-performance liquid chromatography, and compared it with that in the wild-type. As a result, the intracellular DA content in the DA-resistant isolate was significantly lower than that in the wild-type, suggesting that the decreased DA content may contribute to DA-resistance. Additionally, the glucose consumption of the DA-resistant isolate was significantly higher than that of the wild-type, indicating that a large amount of glucose is utilized to maintain DA-resistance. It is possible that a large amount of energy is utilized to maintain the mechanisms of DA-resistance. It was reported that as the structure of DA is similar with that of adenosine, DA may be taken up by the P2 transporter, which contributes to the uptake of adenosine, in Trypanosoma brucei brucei, and that the uptake of adenosine is decreased in DA-resistant T. brucei brucei. In the present study, the adenosine incorporation in the DA-resistant B. gibsoni isolate was higher than in the wild-type. Moreover, the adenosine incorporation in the wild-type was not inhibited by the presence of DA. These results suggest that adenosine transport in B. gibsoni is not affected by DA and may not mediate DA-resistance. To clarify the mechanism of the development of DA resistance in B. gibsoni, we should investigate the cause of the decreased DA content in the DA-resistant isolate in the future."
11,Subcellular localization of glycolytic enzymes and characterization of intermediary metabolism of Trypanosoma rangeli.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2017.06.007,2017-06-25,"['Glucose consumption', 'Glycosome', 'Intermediary metabolism', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Trypanosoma rangeli']","Trypanosoma rangeli is a hemoflagellate protist that infects wild and domestic mammals as well as humans in Central and South America. Although this parasite is not pathogenic for human, it is being studied because it shares with Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, biological characteristics, geographic distribution, vectors and vertebrate hosts. Several metabolic studies have been performed with T. cruzi epimastigotes, however little is known about the metabolism of T. rangeli. In this work we present the subcellular distribution of the T. rangeli enzymes responsible for the conversion of glucose to pyruvate, as determined by epifluorescense immunomicroscopy and subcellular fractionation involving either selective membrane permeabilization with digitonin or differential and isopycnic centrifugation. We found that in T. rangeli epimastigotes the first six enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, involved in the conversion of glucose to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate are located within glycosomes, while the last four steps occur in the cytosol. In contrast with T. cruzi, where three isoenzymes (one cytosolic and two glycosomal) of phosphoglycerate kinase are expressed simultaneously, only one enzyme with this activity is detected in T. rangeli epimastigotes, in the cytosol. Consistent with this latter result, we found enzymes involved in auxiliary pathways to glycolysis needed to maintain adenine nucleotide and redox balances within glycosomes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarate reductase, pyruvate phosphate dikinase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glucokinase, galactokinase and the first enzyme of the pentose-phosphate pathway, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, were also located inside glycosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that T. rangeli epimastigotes growing in LIT medium only consume glucose and do not excrete ammonium; moreover, they are unable to survive in partially-depleted glucose medium. The velocity of glucose consumption is about 40% higher than that of procyclic Trypanosoma brucei, and four times faster than by T. cruzi epimastigotes under the same culture conditions."

Nevertheless, due to subtle, quantitative differences between the biochemical reaction networks of target cell and host, a drug can limit the flux of the same essential process in one organism more than in another. We identified precise criteria for this 'network-based' drug selectivity, which can serve as an alternative or additive to structural differences. We combined computational and experimental approaches to compare energy metabolism in the causative agent of sleeping sickness, Trypanosoma brucei, with that of human erythrocytes, and identified glucose transport and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the most selective antiparasitic targets. Computational predictions were validated experimentally in a novel parasite-erythrocytes co-culture system. Glucose-transport inhibitors killed trypanosomes without killing erythrocytes, neurons or liver cells."

Depletion of TbMCP14 by inducible RNAi in both bloodstream and procyclic forms increased resistance of parasites towards the compounds by 7-fold and 3-fold, respectively, compared to uninduced cells. In addition, down-regulation of TbMCP14 protected bloodstream form mitochondria from a drug-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Conversely, over-expression of the carrier in procyclic forms increased parasite susceptibility more than 13-fold. Metabolomic analyses of parasites over-expressing TbMCP14 showed increased levels of the proline metabolite, pyrroline-5-carboxylate, suggesting a possible involvement of TbMCP14 in energy production. The generation of TbMCP14 knock-out parasites showed that the carrier is not essential for survival of T. brucei bloodstream forms, but reduced parasite proliferation under standard culture conditions. In contrast, depletion of TbMCP14 in procyclic forms resulted in growth arrest, followed by parasite death. The time point at which parasite proliferation stopped was dependent on the major energy source, i.e. glucose versus proline, in the culture medium. Together with our findings that proline-dependent ATP production in crude mitochondria from TbMCP14-depleted trypanosomes was reduced compared to control mitochondria, the study demonstrates that TbMCP14 is involved in energy production in T. brucei. Since TbMCP14 belongs to a trypanosomatid-specific clade of mitochondrial carrier family proteins showing very poor similarity to mitochondrial carriers of mammals, it may represent an interesting target for drug action or targeting."

It can be synthesized de novo from glucose-6-phosphate in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum. Alternatively, it can be taken up from the environment via Na(+)- or H(+)-linked myo-inositol transporters. While Na(+)-coupled myo-inositol transporters are found exclusively in the plasma membrane, H(+)-linked myo-inositol transporters are detected in intracellular organelles. In Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African sleeping sickness, myo-inositol metabolism is compartmentalized. De novo-synthesized myo-inositol is used for glycosylphosphatidylinositol production in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the myo-inositol taken up from the environment is used for bulk phosphatidylinositol synthesis in the Golgi complex. We now provide evidence that the Golgi complex-localized T. brucei H(+)-linked myo-inositol transporter (TbHMIT) is essential in bloodstream-form T. brucei. Downregulation of TbHMIT expression by RNA interference blocked phosphatidylinositol production and inhibited growth of parasites in culture. Characterization of the transporter in a heterologous expression system demonstrated a remarkable selectivity of TbHMIT for myo-inositol. It tolerates only a single modification on the inositol ring, such as the removal of a hydroxyl group or the inversion of stereochemistry at a single hydroxyl group relative to myo-inositol."

Many studies have shown that correct glycosomal compartmentalization of glycolytic enzymes is essential for bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei. The recent finding of pore-forming activities in glycosomal membrane preparations and extensions of the trypanosome glycolysis computer model with size-selective pores sparked again an old debate on the extent of (im)permeability of the glycosomal membrane and whether glycosomally located glycolytic enzymes could and should also be present with some activity in the cytosol. This review presents a critical discussion of the experimental and theoretical evidence for and against the different hypotheses."
17,Trypanosoma brucei eflornithine transporter AAT6 is a low-affinity low-selective transporter for neutral amino acids.,10.1042/BJ20140719,2014-07-06,[],"Amino acid transporters are crucial for parasite survival since the cellular metabolism of parasitic protozoa depends on the up-take of exogenous amino acids. Amino acid transporters are also of high pharmacological relevance because they may mediate uptake of toxic amino acid analogues. In the present study we show that the eflornithine transporter AAT6 from Trypanosoma brucei (TbAAT6) mediates growth on neutral amino acids when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants. The transport was electrogenic and further analysed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Neutral amino acids, proline analogues, eflornithine and acivicin induced inward currents. For proline, glycine and tryptophan the apparent affinities and maximal transport rates increased with more negative membrane potentials. Proline-induced currents were dependent on pH, but not on sodium. Although proline represents the primary energy source of T. brucei in the tsetse fly, down-regulation of TbAAT6-expression by RNAi showed that in culture TbAAT6 is not essential for growth of procyclic form trypanosomes in the presence of glucose or proline as energy source. TbAAT6-RNAi lines of both bloodstream and procyclic form trypanosomes showed reduced susceptibility to eflornithine, whereas the sensitivity to acivicin remained unchanged, indicating that acivicin enters the cell by more than one transporter."

The glycosomes were assumed to be largely impermeable, and exchange of metabolites between the cytosol and the glycosome was assumed to be regulated by specific transporters in the glycosomal membrane. This tight compartmentalization was considered to be essential for parasite viability. Recently, size-specific metabolite pores were discovered in the membrane of glycosomes. These channels are proposed to allow smaller metabolites to diffuse across the membrane but not larger ones. In light of this new finding, we re-analyzed the model taking into account uncertainty about the topology of the metabolic system in T. brucei, as well as uncertainty about the values of all parameters of individual enzymatic reactions. Our analysis shows that these newly-discovered nonspecific pores are not necessarily incompatible with our current knowledge of the glycosomal metabolic system, provided that the known cytosolic activities of the glycosomal enzymes play an important role in the regulation of glycolytic fluxes and the concentration of metabolic intermediates of the pathway."

The endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein Rft1 is intimately involved in mDLO biosynthesis. Yeast genetic analyses implicated Rft1 as the M5-DLO flippase, but because biochemical tests challenged this assignment, the function of Rft1 remains obscure. To understand the role of Rft1, we sought to analyze mDLO biosynthesis in vivo in the complete absence of the protein. Rft1 is essential for yeast viability, and no Rft1-null organisms are currently available. Here, we exploited Trypanosoma brucei (Tb), an early diverging eukaryote whose Rft1 homologue functions in yeast. We report that TbRft1-null procyclic trypanosomes grow nearly normally. They have normal steady-state levels of mDLO and significant N-glycosylation, indicating robust M5-DLO flippase activity. Remarkably, the mutant cells have 30-100-fold greater steady-state levels of M5-DLO than wild-type cells. All N-glycans in the TbRft1-null cells originate from mDLO indicating that the M5-DLO excess is not available for glycosylation. These results suggest that rather than facilitating M5-DLO flipping, Rft1 facilitates conversion of M5-DLO to mDLO by another mechanism, possibly by acting as an M5-DLO chaperone."
20,Peptide-targeted delivery of a pH sensor for quantitative measurements of intraglycosomal pH in live Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1021/bi400029m,2013-05-09,[],"Studies of dynamic changes in organelles of protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei have been limited, in part because of the difficulty of targeting analytical probes to specific subcellular compartments. Here we demonstrate application of a ratiometric probe for pH quantification in T. brucei glycosomes. The probe consists of a peptide encoding the peroxisomal targeting sequence (F-PTS1, acetyl-CKGGAKL) coupled to fluorescein, which responds to pH. When incubated with living parasites, the probe is internalized within vesicular structures that colocalize with a glycosomal marker. Inhibition of uptake of F-PTS1 at 4 °C and pulse-chase colocalization with fluorescent dextran suggested that the probe is initially taken up by non-receptor-mediated endocytosis but is subsequently transported separately from dextran and localized within glycosomes, prior to the final fusion of labeled glycosomes and lysosomes as part of glycosomal turnover. Intraorganellar measurements and pH calibration with F-PTS1 in T. brucei glycosomes indicate that the resting glycosomal pH under physiological conditions is 7.4 ± 0.2. However, incubation in glucose-depleted buffer triggered mild acidification of the glycosome over a period of 20 min, with a final observed pH of 6.8 ± 0.3. This glycosomal acidification was reversed by reintroduction of glucose. Coupling of ratiometric fluorescent sensors and reporters to PTS peptides offers an invaluable tool for monitoring in situ glycosomal response(s) to changing environmental conditions and could be applied to additional kinetoplastid parasites."

In the studies reported here, genetic complementation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been employed to identify a gene (TbPT0) that encodes this vital pyruvate transporter from T. brucei. Expression of TbPT0 in S. cerevisiae reveals that TbPT0 is a high affinity pyruvate transporter. TbPT0 belongs to a clustered multigene family consisting of five members, whose expression is up-regulated in the bloodstream form. Interestingly, TbPT family permeases are related to polytopic proteins from plants but not to characterized monocarboxylate transporters from mammals. Remarkably, inhibition of the TbPT gene family expression in bloodstream parasites by RNAi is lethal, confirming the physiological relevance of these transporters. The discovery of TbPT0 reveals for the first time the identity of the essential pyruvate transporter and provides a potential drug target against the mammalian life cycle stage of T. brucei."

Its digenetic life cycle alternates between the bloodstream form in the mammalian host and the procyclic form (PCF) in the bloodsucking insect vector, the tsetse fly. PCF trypanosomes rely in the glucose-depleted environment of the insect vector primarily on the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of proline for their cellular ATP provision. We previously identified two T. brucei mitochondrial carrier family proteins, TbMCP5 and TbMCP15, with significant sequence similarity to functionally characterized ADP/ATP carriers from other eukaryotes. Comprehensive sequence analysis confirmed that TbMCP5 contains canonical ADP/ATP carrier sequence features, whereas they are not conserved in TbMCP15. Heterologous expression in the ANC-deficient yeast strain JL1Δ2Δ3u(-) revealed that only TbMCP5 was able to restore its growth on the non-fermentable carbon source lactate. Transport studies in yeast mitochondria showed that TbMCP5 has biochemical properties and ADP/ATP exchange kinetics similar to those of Anc2p, the prototypical ADP/ATP carrier of S. cerevisiae. Immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis confirmed that TbMCP5 is exclusively mitochondrial and is differentially expressed with 4.5-fold more TbMCP5 in the procyclic form of the parasite. Silencing of TbMCP5 expression in PCF T. brucei revealed that this ADP/ATP carrier is essential for parasite growth, particularly when depending on proline for energy generation. Moreover, ADP/ATP exchange in isolated T. brucei mitochondria was eliminated upon TbMCP5 depletion. These results confirmed that TbMCP5 functions as the main ADP/ATP carrier in the trypanosome mitochondrion. The important role of TbMCP5 in the T. brucei energy metabolism is further discussed."
23,Phosphoglucomutase is absent in Trypanosoma brucei and redundantly substituted by phosphomannomutase and phospho-N-acetylglucosamine mutase.,10.1111/j.1365-2958.2012.08124.x,2012-06-09,[],"The enzymes phosphomannomutase (PMM), phospho-N-acetylglucosamine mutase (PAGM) and phosphoglucomutase (PGM) reversibly catalyse the transfer of phosphate between the C6 and C1 hydroxyl groups of mannose, N-acetylglucosamine and glucose respectively. Although genes for a candidate PMM and a PAGM enzymes have been found in the Trypanosoma brucei genome, there is, surprisingly, no candidate gene for PGM. The TbPMM and TbPAGM genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and the TbPMM enzyme was crystallized and its structure solved at 1.85 Å resolution. Antibodies to the recombinant proteins localized endogenous TbPMM to glycosomes in the bloodstream form of the parasite, while TbPAGM localized to both the cytosol and glycosomes. Both recombinant enzymes were able to interconvert glucose-phosphates, as well as acting on their own definitive substrates. Analysis of sugar nucleotide levels in parasites with TbPMM or TbPAGM knocked down by RNA interference (RNAi) suggests that, in vivo, PGM activity is catalysed by both enzymes. This is the first example in any organism of PGM activity being completely replaced in this way and it explains why, uniquely, T. brucei has been able to lose its PGM gene. The RNAi data for TbPMM also showed that this is an essential gene for parasite growth."

Over 10 000 new victims are reported each year, with hundreds of thousands more at risk. As current drug treatments are either highly toxic or ineffective, novel trypanocides are urgently needed. The T. brucei galactose synthesis pathway is one potential therapeutic target. Although galactose is essential for T. brucei survival, the parasite lacks the transporters required to intake galactose from the environment. UDP-galactose 4'-epimerase (TbGalE) is responsible for the epimerization of UDP-glucose to UDP-galactose and is therefore of great interest to medicinal chemists. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the atomistic motions of TbGalE in both the apo and holo states. The sampled conformations and protein dynamics depend not only on the presence of a UDP-sugar ligand, but also on the chirality of the UDP-sugar C4 atom. This dependence provides important insights into TbGalE function and may help guide future computer-aided drug discovery efforts targeting this protein."
25,ATP synthesis-coupled and -uncoupled acetate production from acetyl-CoA by mitochondrial acetate:succinate CoA-transferase and acetyl-CoA thioesterase in Trypanosoma.,10.1074/jbc.M112.355404,2012-04-05,[],"Insect stage trypanosomes use an ""acetate shuttle"" to transfer mitochondrial acetyl-CoA to the cytosol for the essential fatty acid biosynthesis. The mitochondrial acetate sources are acetate:succinate CoA-transferase (ASCT) and an unknown enzymatic activity. We have identified a gene encoding acetyl-CoA thioesterase (ACH) activity, which is shown to be the second acetate source. First, RNAi-mediated repression of ASCT in the ACH null background abolishes acetate production from glucose, as opposed to both single ASCT and ACH mutants. Second, incorporation of radiolabeled glucose into fatty acids is also abolished in this ACH/ASCT double mutant. ASCT is involved in ATP production, whereas ACH is not, because the ASCT null mutant is ∼1000 times more sensitive to oligomycin, a specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial F(0)/F(1)-ATP synthase, than wild-type cells or the ACH null mutant. This was confirmed by RNAi repression of the F(0)/F(1)-ATP synthase F(1)β subunit, which is lethal when performed in the ASCT null background but not in the wild-type cells or the ACH null background. We concluded that acetate is produced from both ASCT and ACH; however, only ASCT is responsible, together with the F(0)/F(1)-ATP synthase, for ATP production in the mitochondrion."

Intracellular myo-inositol is generated by de novo synthesis from glucose 6-phosphate or is provided from the environment via myo-inositol symporters. We show that in Trypanosoma brucei, the causative pathogen of human African sleeping sickness and nagana in domestic animals, myo-inositol is taken up via a specific proton-coupled electrogenic symport and that this transport is essential for parasite survival in culture. Down-regulation of the myo-inositol transporter using RNA interference inhibited uptake of myo-inositol and blocked the synthesis of the myo-inositol-containing phospholipids, phosphatidylinositol and inositol phosphorylceramide; in contrast, it had no effect on glycosylphosphatidylinositol production. This together with the unexpected localization of the myo-inositol transporter in both the plasma membrane and the Golgi demonstrate that metabolism of endogenous and exogenous myo-inositol in T. brucei is strictly segregated."

Much of our understanding of metabolism in these organisms has been gained form the study of the human infective representatives (Trypanosoma brucei subpecies, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp.) which are transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods. The insect vectors of these parasites use proline as a principal carbon and energy source circulating in their haemolymph. Accordingly the insect-forms of the human infectious parasites have evolved to exploit abundant proline when in this environment, but being able to activate different biochemical pathways when in other environments. Interestingly, if glucose is available, metabolic capability can shift to make this carbohydrate the preferred substrate. Proline has also been shown to play key roles in osmoregulation, differentiation in representatives of the group and may even play a role in immunosuppression elicited by the American trypanosome T. cruzi. This review focuses on recent progress in understanding the different aspects of proline metabolism in trypanosomatids, with a particular interest on the insect forms."
28,A domino effect in drug action: from metabolic assault towards parasite differentiation.,10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07435.x,2010-12-21,[],"Awareness is growing that drug target validation should involve systems analysis of cellular networks. There is less appreciation, though, that the composition of networks may change in response to drugs. If the response is homeostatic (e.g. through upregulation of the target protein), this may neutralize the inhibitory effect. In this scenario the effect on cell growth and survival would be less than anticipated based on affinity of the drug for its target. Glycolysis is the sole free-energy source for the deadly parasite Trypanosoma brucei and is therefore a possible target pathway for anti-trypanosomal drugs. Plasma-membrane glucose transport exerts high control over trypanosome glycolysis and hence the transporter is a promising drug target. Here we show that at high inhibitor concentrations, inhibition of trypanosome glucose transport causes cell death. Most interestingly, sublethal concentrations initiate a domino effect in which network adaptations enhance inhibition. This happens via (i) metabolic control exerted by the target protein, (ii) decreases in mRNAs encoding the target protein and other proteins in the same pathway, and (iii) partial differentiation of the cells leading to (low) expression of immunogenic insect-stage coat proteins. We discuss how these 'anti-homeostatic' responses together may facilitate killing of parasites at an acceptable drug dosage."
29,"Glycosomal ABC transporters of Trypanosoma brucei: characterisation of their expression, topology and substrate specificity.",10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.11.002,2010-12-18,[],"Metabolism in trypanosomatids is compartmentalised with major pathways, notably glycolysis, present in peroxisome-like organelles called glycosomes. To date, little information is available about the transport of metabolites through the glycosomal membrane. Previously, three ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, called GAT1-3 for Glycosomal ABC Transporters 1 to 3, have been identified in the glycosomal membrane of Trypanosoma brucei. Here we report that GAT1 and GAT3 are expressed both in bloodstream and procyclic form trypanosomes, whereas GAT2 is mainly or exclusively expressed in bloodstream-form cells. Protease protection experiments showed that the nucleotide-binding domain of GAT1 and GAT3 is exposed to the cytosol, indicating that these transporters mediate the ATP-dependent uptake of solutes from the cytosol into the glycosomal lumen. Depletion of GAT1 and GAT3 by RNA interference in procyclic cells grown in glucose-containing medium did not affect growth. Surprisingly, GAT1 depletion enhanced the expression of the very different GAT3 protein. Expression knockdown of GAT1, but not GAT3, in procyclic cells cultured in glucose-free medium was lethal. Depletion of GAT1 in glucose-grown procyclic cells caused a modification of the total cellular fatty-acid composition. No or only minor changes were observed in the levels of most fatty acids, including oleate (C18:1), nevertheless the linoleate (C18:2) abundance was significantly increased upon GAT1 silencing. Furthermore, glycosomes purified from procyclic wild-type cells incorporate oleoyl-CoA in a concentration- and ATP-dependent manner, whilst this incorporation was severely reduced in glycosomes from cells in which GAT1 levels had been decreased. Together, these results strongly suggest that GAT1 serves to transport primarily oleoyl-CoA, but possibly also other fatty acids, from the cytosol into the glycosomal lumen and that its depletion results in a cellular linoleate accumulation, probably due to the presence of an active oleate desaturase. The role of intraglycosomal oleoyl-CoA and its essentiality when the trypanosomes are grown in the absence of glucose, are discussed."
30,Comparative studies on the biochemical properties of the malic enzymes from Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1111/j.1574-6968.2010.02142.x,2010-11-26,[],"Comparative studies showed that, like Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei exhibits functional cytosolic and mitochondrial malic enzymes (MEs), which are specifically linked to NADP. Kinetic studies provided evidence that T. cruzi and T. brucei MEs display similarly high affinities towards NADP(+) and are also almost equally efficient in catalyzing the production of NADPH. Nevertheless, in contrast to the cytosolic ME from T. cruzi, which is highly activated by l-aspartate (over 10-fold), the T. brucei homologue is slightly more active (50%) in the presence of this amino acid. In T. brucei, both isozymes appear to be clearly more abundant in the insect stage, although they can be immunodetected in the bloodstream forms. By contrast, in T. cruzi the expression of the mitochondrial ME seems to be clearly upregulated in amastigotes, whereas the cytosolic isoform appears to be more abundant in the insect stages of the parasite. It might be hypothesized that in those environments where glucose is very low or absent, these pathogens depend on NADP-linked dehydrogenases such as the MEs for NADPH production, as in those conditions the pentose phosphate pathway cannot serve as a source of essential reducing power."
31,The F(0)F(1)-ATP synthase complex contains novel subunits and is essential for procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1371/journal.ppat.1000436,2009-05-14,[],"The mitochondrial F(0)F(1) ATP synthase is an essential multi-subunit protein complex in the vast majority of eukaryotes but little is known about its composition and role in Trypanosoma brucei, an early diverged eukaryotic pathogen. We purified the F(0)F(1) ATP synthase by a combination of affinity purification, immunoprecipitation and blue-native gel electrophoresis and characterized its composition and function. We identified 22 proteins of which five are related to F(1) subunits, three to F(0) subunits, and 14 which have no obvious homology to proteins outside the kinetoplastids. RNAi silencing of expression of the F(1) alpha subunit or either of the two novel proteins showed that they are each essential for the viability of procyclic (insect stage) cells and are important for the structural integrity of the F(0)F(1)-ATP synthase complex. We also observed a dramatic decrease in ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation after silencing expression of each of these proteins while substrate phosphorylation was not severely affected. Our procyclic T. brucei cells were sensitive to the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin even in the presence of glucose contrary to earlier reports. Hence, the two novel proteins appear essential for the structural organization of the functional complex and regulation of mitochondrial energy generation in these organisms is more complicated than previously thought."
32,"Strategies for acquiring the phospholipid metabolite inositol in pathogenic bacteria, fungi and protozoa: making it and taking it.",10.1099/mic.0.025718-0,2009-04-23,[],"myo-Inositol (inositol) is an essential nutrient that is used for building phosphatidylinositol and its derivatives in eukaryotes and even in some eubacteria such as the mycobacteria. As a consequence, fungal, protozoan and mycobacterial pathogens must be able to acquire inositol in order to proliferate and cause infection in their hosts. There are two primary mechanisms for acquiring inositol. One is to synthesize inositol from glucose 6-phosphate using two sequentially acting enzymes: inositol-3-phosphate synthase (Ino1p) converts glucose 6-phosphate to inositol 3-phosphate, and then inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) dephosphorylates inositol 3-phosphate to generate inositol. The other mechanism is to import inositol from the environment via inositol transporters. Inositol is readily abundant in the bloodstream of mammalian hosts, providing a source from which many pathogens could potentially import inositol. However, despite this abundance of inositol in the host, some pathogens such as the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the protist parasite Trypanosoma brucei must be able to make inositol de novo in order to cause disease (M. tuberculosis) or even grow (T. brucei). Other pathogens such as the fungus Candida albicans are equally adept at causing disease by importing inositol or by making it de novo. The role of inositol acquisition in the biology and pathogenesis of the parasite Leishmania and the fungus Cryptococcus are being explored as well. The specific strategies used by these pathogens to acquire inositol while in the host are discussed in relation to each pathogen's unique metabolic requirements."
33,Compartmentation prevents a lethal turbo-explosion of glycolysis in trypanosomes.,10.1073/pnas.0806664105,2008-11-15,[],"ATP generation by both glycolysis and glycerol catabolism is autocatalytic, because the first kinases of these pathways are fuelled by ATP produced downstream. Previous modeling studies predicted that either feedback inhibition or compartmentation of glycolysis can protect cells from accumulation of intermediates. The deadly parasite Trypanosoma brucei lacks feedback regulation of early steps in glycolysis yet sequesters the relevant enzymes within organelles called glycosomes, leading to the proposal that compartmentation prevents toxic accumulation of intermediates. Here, we show that glucose 6-phosphate indeed accumulates upon glucose addition to PEX14 deficient trypanosomes, which are impaired in glycosomal protein import. With glycerol catabolism, both in silico and in vivo, loss of glycosomal compartmentation led to dramatic increases of glycerol 3-phosphate upon addition of glycerol. As predicted by the model, depletion of glycerol kinase rescued PEX14-deficient cells of glycerol toxicity. This provides the first experimental support for our hypothesis that pathway compartmentation is an alternative to allosteric regulation."
34,An expression system to screen for inhibitors of parasite glucose transporters.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2008.07.005,2008-08-19,[],"Chemotherapy of parasitic protists is limited by general toxicity, high expense and emergence of resistance to currently available drugs. Thus methods to identify new leads for further drug development are increasingly important. Previously, glucose transporters have been validated as new drug targets for protozoan parasites including Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania mexicana and Trypanosoma brucei. A recently derived glucose transporter null mutant (Deltalmgt) of L. mexicana was used to functionally express various heterologous glucose transporters including those from T. brucei THT1, P. falciparum PfHT and human GLUT1-resulting in recovery of growth of the Deltalmgt null mutant in glucose replete medium. This heterologous expression system can be employed to screen for compounds that retard growth by inhibiting the expressed glucose transporter. The ability of this expression system to identify specific glucose transporter inhibitors was demonstrated using 3-O-undec-10-enyl-d-glucose, a previously described specific inhibitor of PfHT."
35,Glucose-induced remodeling of intermediary and energy metabolism in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.M709592200,2008-04-24,[],"The procyclic form of Trypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protozoan that normally dwells in the midgut of its insect vector. In vitro, this parasite prefers d-glucose to l -proline as a carbon source, although this amino acid is the main carbon source available in its natural habitat. Here, we investigated how l -proline is metabolized in glucose-rich and glucose-depleted conditions. Analysis of the excreted end products of (13)C-enriched l -proline metabolism showed that the amino acid is converted into succinate or l -alanine depending on the presence or absence of d-glucose, respectively. The fact that the pathway of l -proline metabolism was truncated in glucose-rich conditions was confirmed by the analysis of 13 separate RNA interference-harboring or knock-out cell lines affecting different steps of this pathway. For instance, RNA interference studies revealed the loss of succinate dehydrogenase activity to be conditionally lethal only in the absence of d-glucose, confirming that in glucose-depleted conditions, l -proline needs to be converted beyond succinate. In addition, depletion of the F(0)/F(1)-ATP synthase activity by RNA interference led to cell death in glucose-depleted medium, but not in glucose-rich medium. This implies that, in the presence of d-glucose, the importance of the F(0)/F(1)-ATP synthase is diminished and ATP is produced by substrate level phosphorylation. We conclude that trypanosomes develop an elaborate adaptation of their energy production pathways in response to carbon source availability."
36,N-acetyl D-glucosamine stimulates growth in procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei by inducing a metabolic shift.,10.1017/S0031182008004241,2008-03-29,[],"SUMMARYThe lectin-inhibitory sugars D-glucosamine (GlcN) and N-acetyl D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) are known to enhance susceptibility of the tsetse fly vector to infection with Trypanosoma brucei. GlcNAc also stimulates trypanosome growth in vitro in the absence of any factor derived from the fly. Here, we show that GlcNAc cannot be used as a direct energy source, nor is it internalized by trypanosomes. It does, however, inhibit glucose uptake by binding to the hexose transporter. Deprivation of D-glucose leads to a switch from a metabolism based predominantly on substrate level phosphorylation of D-glucose to a more efficient one based mainly on oxidative phosphorylation using L-proline. Procyclic form trypanosomes grow faster and to higher density in D-glucose-depleted medium than in D-glucose-rich medium. The ability of trypanosomes to use L-proline as an energy source can be regulated depending upon the availability of D-glucose and here we show that this regulation is a graded response to D-glucose availability and determined by the overall metabolic state of the cell. It appears, therefore, that the growth stimulatory effect of GlcNAc in vitro relates to the switch from D-glucose to L-proline metabolism. In tsetse flies, however, it seems probable that the effect of GlcNAc is independent of this switch as pre-adaptation to growth in proline had no effect on tsetse infection rate."
37,Drugs and transporters in kinetoplastid protozoa.,10.1007/978-0-387-77570-8_3,2008-03-28,[],"Kinetoplastid protozoa express hundreds of membrane transport proteins that allow them to take up nutrients, establish ion gradients, efflux metabolites, translocate compounds from one intracellular compartment to another, and take up or export drugs. The combination of molecular cloning, genetic approaches, and the completed genome projects for Trypanosoma brucei, Leishmania major, and Trypanosoma cruzi have allowed detailed functional analysis of various transporters and predictions about the likely functions of others. Thus many opportunities exist to define the biological and pharmacological properties of parasite transporters whose genes were often difficult to identify in the pregenomic era. A subset of these transporters that are essential for parasite viability could serve as targets for novel drug therapies by identifying compounds that interfere with their uptake functions. Other permeases provide routes for uptake of selectively cytotoxic compounds and can thus be useful for delivery of drugs. Drug resistance may develop in strains where such drug uptake transporters are nonfunctional or in parasites that over-express other permeases that export a drug. A summary of recent work on Leishmania transporters for glucose and for purines is provided as an example of permeases that are being studied in molecular detail."
38,Targeting of toxic compounds to the trypanosome's interior.,10.1016/S0065-308X(06)63002-9,2006-12-01,[],"Drugs can be targeted into African trypanosomes by exploiting carrier proteins at the surface of these parasites. This has been clearly demonstrated in the case of the melamine-based arsenical and the diamidine classes of drug that are already in use in the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis. These drugs can enter via an aminopurine transporter, termed P2, encoded by the TbAT1 gene. Other toxic compounds have also been designed to enter via this transporter. Some of these compounds enter almost exclusively through the P2 transporter, and hence loss of the P2 transporter leads to significant resistance to these particular compounds. It now appears, however, that some diamidines and melaminophenylarsenicals may also be taken up by other routes (of yet unknown function). These too may be exploited to target new drugs into trypanosomes. Additional purine nucleoside and nucleobase transporters have also been subverted to deliver toxic agents to trypanosomes. Glucose and amino acid transporters too have been investigated with a view to manipulating them to carry toxins into Trypanosoma brucei, and recent work has demonstrated that aquaglyceroporins may also have considerable potential for drug-targeting. Transporters, including those that carry lipids and vitamins such as folate and other pterins also deserve more attention in this regard. Some drugs, for example suramin, appear to enter via routes other than plasma-membrane-mediated transport. Receptor-mediated endocytosis has been proposed as a possible way in for suramin. Endocytosis also appears to be crucial in targeting natural trypanocides, such as trypanosome lytic factor (TLF) (apolipoprotein L1), into trypanosomes and this offers an alternative means of selectively targeting toxins to the trypanosome's interior. Other compounds may be induced to enter by increasing their capacity to diffuse over cell membranes; in this case depending exclusively on selective activity within the cell rather than selective uptake to impart selective toxicity. This review outlines studies that have aimed to exploit trypanosome nutrient uptake routes to selectively carry toxins into these parasites."
39,Galactose starvation in a bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei UDP-glucose 4'-epimerase conditional null mutant.,10.1128/EC.00156-06,2006-11-10,[],"Galactose metabolism is essential for the survival of Trypanosoma brucei, the etiological agent of African sleeping sickness. T. brucei hexose transporters are unable to transport galactose, which is instead obtained through the epimerization of UDP-glucose to UDP-galactose catalyzed by UDP-glucose 4'-epimerase (galE). Here, we have characterized the phenotype of a bloodstream form T. brucei galE conditional null mutant under nonpermissive conditions that induced galactose starvation. Cellular levels of UDP-galactose dropped rapidly upon induction of galactose starvation, reaching undetectable levels after 72 h. Analysis of extracted glycoproteins by ricin and tomato lectin blotting showed that terminal beta-d-galactose was virtually eliminated and poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures were substantially reduced. Mass spectrometric analysis of variant surface glycoprotein confirmed complete loss of galactose from the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. After 96 h, cell division ceased, and electron microscopy revealed that the cells had adopted a morphologically distinct stumpy-like form, concurrent with the appearance of aberrant vesicles close to the flagellar pocket. These data demonstrate that the UDP-glucose 4'-epimerase is essential for the production of UDP-galactose required for galactosylation of glycoproteins and that galactosylation of one or more glycoproteins, most likely in the lysosomal/endosomal system, is essential for the survival of bloodstream form T. brucei."
40,Experimental and in silico analyses of glycolytic flux control in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.M502403200,2005-06-16,[],"A mathematical model of glycolysis in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei was developed previously on the basis of all available enzyme kinetic data (Bakker, B. M., Michels, P. A. M., Opperdoes, F. R., and Westerhoff, H. V. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 3207-3215). The model predicted correctly the fluxes and cellular metabolite concentrations as measured in non-growing trypanosomes and the major contribution to the flux control exerted by the plasma membrane glucose transporter. Surprisingly, a large overcapacity was predicted for hexokinase (HXK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and pyruvate kinase (PYK). Here, we present our further analysis of the control of glycolytic flux in bloodstream form T. brucei. First, the model was optimized and extended with recent information about the kinetics of enzymes and their activities as measured in lysates of in vitro cultured growing trypanosomes. Second, the concentrations of five glycolytic enzymes (HXK, PFK, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, and PYK) in trypanosomes were changed by RNA interference. The effects of the knockdown of these enzymes on the growth, activities, and levels of various enzymes and glycolytic flux were studied and compared with model predictions. Data thus obtained support the conclusion from the in silico analysis that HXK, PFK, and PYK are in excess, albeit less than predicted. Interestingly, depletion of PFK and enolase had an effect on the activity (but not, or to a lesser extent, expression) of some other glycolytic enzymes. Enzymes located both in the glycosomes (the peroxisome-like organelles harboring the first seven enzymes of the glycolytic pathway of trypanosomes) and in the cytosol were affected. These data suggest the existence of novel regulatory mechanisms operating in trypanosome glycolysis."
41,Energy generation in insect stages of Trypanosoma brucei: metabolism in flux.,10.1016/j.pt.2005.02.008,2005-03-23,[],"The generation of energy in African trypanosomes is a subject of undoubted importance. In bloodstream-form organisms, substrate-level phosphorylation of glucose is sufficient to provide the energy needs of the parasite. The situation in procyclic-form trypanosomes is more complex. For many years, it was accepted that glucose metabolism followed a conventional scheme involving glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and ATP-producing oxidative phosphorylation linked to the electron-transport chain. However, progress in sequencing the Trypanosoma brucei genome and the development of gene-knockout and RNA interference technology has provided novel insight. Coupling these new technologies with classical approaches, including NMR and mass spectrometry to analyse glycolytic intermediates and end products, has yielded several surprises. In this article, we summarize how these recent data have helped to change the view of metabolism in procyclic-form T. brucei."
42,"New functions for parts of the Krebs cycle in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei, a cycle not operating as a cycle.",10.1074/jbc.M412447200,2005-01-14,[],"We investigated whether substrate availability influences the type of energy metabolism in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei. We show that absence of glycolytic substrates (glucose and glycerol) does not induce a shift from a fermentative metabolism to complete oxidation of substrates. We also show that glucose (and even glycolysis) is not essential for normal functioning and proliferation of pleomorphic procyclic T. brucei cells. Furthermore, absence of glucose did not result in increased degradation of amino acids. Variations in availability of glucose and glycerol did result, however, in adaptations in metabolism in such a way that the glycosome was always in redox balance. We argue that it is likely that, in procyclic cells, phosphoglycerate kinase is located not only in the cytosol, but also inside glycosomes, as otherwise an ATP deficit would occur in this organelle. We demonstrate that procyclic T. brucei uses parts of the Krebs cycle for purposes other than complete degradation of mitochondrial substrates. We suggest that citrate synthase plus pyruvate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase are used to transport acetyl-CoA units from the mitochondrion to the cytosol for the biosynthesis of fatty acids, a process we show to occur in proliferating procyclic cells. The part of the Krebs cycle consisting of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase was used for the degradation of proline and glutamate to succinate. We also demonstrate that the subsequent enzymes of the Krebs cycle, succinate dehydrogenase and fumarase, are most likely used for conversion of succinate into malate, which can then be used in gluconeogenesis."
44,"Cloning, heterologous expression, and characterization of three aquaglyceroporins from Trypanosoma brucei.",10.1074/jbc.M404518200,2004-08-06,[],"Trypanosoma brucei, causative for African sleeping sickness, relies exclusively on glycolysis for ATP production. Under anaerobic conditions, glucose is converted to equimolar amounts of glycerol and pyruvate, which are both secreted from the parasite. As we have shown previously, glycerol transport in T. brucei occurs via specific membrane proteins (Wille, U., Schade, B., and Duszenko, M. (1998) Eur. J. Biochem. 256, 245-250). Here, we describe cloning and biochemical characterization of the three trypanosomal aquaglyceroporins (AQP; TbAQP1-3), which show a 40-45% identity to mammalian AQP3 and -9. AQPs belong to the major intrinsic protein family and represent channels for small non-ionic molecules. Both TbAQP1 and TbAQP3 contain two highly conserved NPA motifs within the pore-forming region, whereas TbAQP2 contains NSA and NPS motifs instead, which are only occasionally found in AQPs. For functional characterization, all three proteins were heterologously expressed in yeast and Xenopus oocytes. In the yeast fps1Delta mutant, TbAQPs suppressed hypoosmosensitivity and rendered cells to a hyper-osmosensitive phenotype, as expected for unregulated glycerol channels. Under iso- and hyperosmotic conditions, these cells constitutively released glycerol, consistent with a glycerol efflux function of TbAQP proteins. TbAQP expression in Xenopus oocytes increased permeability for water, glycerol and, interestingly, dihydroxyacetone. Except for urea, TbAQPs were virtually impermeable for other polyols; only TbAQP3 transported erythritol and ribitol. Thus, TbAQPs represent mainly water/glycerol/dihydroxyacetone channels involved in osmoregulation and glycerol metabolism in T. brucei. This function and especially the so far not investigated transport of dihydroxyacetone may be pivotal for the survival of the parasite survival under non-aerobic or osmotic stress conditions."
45,Expression of a major surface protein of Trypanosoma brucei insect forms is controlled by the activity of mitochondrial enzymes.,10.1091/mbc.e04-04-0341,2004-06-18,[],"In cycling between the mammalian host and the tsetse fly vector, trypanosomes undergo major changes in energy metabolism and surface coat composition. Early procyclic (insect) forms in the tsetse fly midgut are coated by glycoproteins known as EP and GPEET procyclins. EP expression continues in late procyclic forms, whereas GPEET is down-regulated. In culture, expression of GPEET is modulated by glycerol or glucose. Here, we demonstrate that a glycerol-responsive element of 25 nucleotides within the 3' untranslated region of GPEET mRNA also controls expression by glucose and during development in the fly. In trypanosomes, mitochondrial ATP is produced mainly by the acetate: succinate-CoA transferase/succinyl-CoA synthetase (ASCT) cycle, the citric acid cycle, and the cytochromes. Silencing of the pyruvate dehydrogenase or succinyl-CoA synthetase from the ASCT cycle by RNA interference induces reexpression of GPEET in late procyclic forms, whereas inhibition of the citric acid cycle or the cytochromes has no effect. In contrast, inhibition of the alternative oxidase, the second branch of the electron transport chain, with salicylhydroxamic acid overrides the effect of glucose or glycerol and causes a reduction in the level of GPEET mRNA. Our results reveal a new mechanism by which expression of a surface glycoprotein is controlled by the activity of mitochondrial enzymes."
46,Interaction of substituted hexose analogues with the Trypanosoma brucei hexose transporter.,10.1016/j.bcp.2003.09.005,2004-03-24,[],"Glucose metabolism is essential for survival of bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei subspecies which cause human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Hexose analogues may represent good compounds to inhibit glucose metabolism in these cells. Delivery of such compounds to the parasite is a major consideration in drug development. A series of D-glucose and D-fructose analogues were developed to explore the limits of the structure-activity relationship of the THT1 hexose transporter of bloodstream form African trypanosomes, a portal that might be exploited for drug uptake. D-glucose analogues with substituents at the C2 and C6 position continued to interact with the exofacial hexose binding site of the transporter. There was a limit to the size at C6 which still permitted recognition, although compounds carrying large groups at position C2 were still recognised. However, radiolabelled N-acetyl-D-[1-14C] glucosamine was not internalised by trypanosomes, in spite of the ability of this compound to inhibit glucose uptake, indicating that there is a limit to the size of C2 substituent that allows translocation. Addition of an alkylating group (bromoacetyl) at position C2 in the D-glucose series and at position 6 in the D-fructose set, created two analogues which interact with the transporter and kill trypanosomes in vitro. This indicates that inhibition of the transporter may be a good means of killing trypanosomes."
47,The adenosine analog tubercidin inhibits glycolysis in Trypanosoma brucei as revealed by an RNA interference library.,10.1074/jbc.M309320200,2003-09-16,[],"We used an RNA interference (RNAi) library in a forward genetic selection to study the mechanism of toxicity of tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine) to procyclic Trypanosoma brucei. Following transfection of cells with an RNAi-based genomic library, we used 5 microm tubercidin to select a drug-resistant cell line. Surprisingly, we found in these resistant cells that the hexose transporters had been silenced. We subsequently found that silencing of hexokinase, a glycolytic enzyme, also yielded tubercidin-resistant parasites. These observations suggested that glycolysis could be a target of tubercidin action and that RNAi silencing of glycolytic enzymes was gradual enough to allow the parasites to adapt to alternative sources of energy. Indeed, adaptation of procyclic trypanosomes to a glucose-independent metabolism by reduction of glucose in the culture medium caused tubercidin resistance. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis of glycolytic intermediates from parasites treated with tubercidin showed a dose-dependent increase in concentration of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, a substrate of phosphoglycerate kinase. Furthermore, tubercidin triphosphate inhibited recombinant T. brucei phosphoglycerate kinase activity in vitro with an IC50 of 7.5 microm. We conclude that 5 microm tubercidin kills trypanosomes by targeting glycolysis, especially by inhibition of phosphoglycerate kinase."
48,Procyclic Trypanosoma brucei do not use Krebs cycle activity for energy generation.,10.1074/jbc.M213190200,2003-02-04,[],"The importance of a functional Krebs cycle for energy generation in the procyclic stage of Trypanosoma brucei was investigated under physiological conditions during logarithmic phase growth of a pleomorphic parasite strain. Wild type procyclic cells and mutants with targeted deletion of the gene coding for aconitase were derived by synchronous in vitro differentiation from wild type and mutant (Delta aco::NEO/Delta aco::HYG) bloodstream stage parasites, respectively, where aconitase is not expressed and is dispensable. No differences in intracellular levels of glycolytic and Krebs cycle intermediates were found in procyclic wild type and mutant cells, except for citrate that accumulated up to 90-fold in the mutants, confirming the absence of aconitase activity. Surprisingly, deletion of aconitase did not change differentiation nor the growth rate or the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio in those cells. Metabolic studies using radioactively labeled substrates and NMR analysis demonstrated that glucose and proline were not degraded via the Krebs cycle to CO(2). Instead, glucose was degraded to acetate, succinate, and alanine, whereas proline was degraded to succinate. Importantly, there was absolutely no difference in the metabolic products released by wild type and aconitase knockout parasites, and both were for survival strictly dependent on respiration via the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Hence, although the Krebs cycle enzymes are present, procyclic T. brucei do not use Krebs cycle activity for energy generation, but the mitochondrial respiratory chain is essential for survival and growth. We therefore propose a revised model of the energy metabolism of procyclic T. brucei."
49,"Synthesis and biological activity of nitro heterocycles analogous to megazol, a trypanocidal lead.",10.1021/jm021030a,2003-01-24,[],"As part of our efforts to develop new compounds aimed at the therapy of parasitic infections, we synthesized and assayed analogues of a lead compound megazol, 5-(1-methyl-5-nitro-1H-2-imidazolyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amine, CAS no. 19622-55-0), in vitro. We first developed a new route for the synthesis of megazol. Subsequently several structural changes were introduced, including substitutions on the two rings of the basic nucleus, replacement of the thiadiazole by an oxadiazole, replacement of the nitroimidazole part by a nitrofurane or a nitrothiophene, and substitutions on the exocyclic nitrogen atom for evaluation of an improved import by the glucose or the purine transporters. Assays of the series of compounds on the protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania donovani, as either extracellular cells or infected macrophages, indicated that megazol was more active than the derivatives. Megazol was then evaluated on primates infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, including late-stage central nervous system infections in combination with suramin. Full recovery was observed in five monkeys in the study with no relapse of parasitemia within a 2 year follow-up. Because there is a lack of efficacious treatments for sleeping sickness in Africa and Chagas disease in South America, megazol is proposed as a potential alternative. The mutagenicity of this compound is at present being reevaluated, and metabolism is also under investigation prior to possible further developments."
50,Galactose metabolism is essential for the African sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1073/pnas.092669999,2002-05-02,[],"The tsetse fly-transmitted protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of human African sleeping sickness and the cattle disease Nagana. The bloodstream form of the parasite uses a dense cell-surface coat of variant surface glycoprotein to escape the innate and adaptive immune responses of the mammalian host and a highly glycosylated transferrin receptor to take up host transferrin, an essential growth factor. These glycoproteins, as well as other flagellar pocket, endosomal, and lysosomal glycoproteins, are known to contain galactose. The parasite is unable to take up galactose, suggesting that it may depend on the action of UDP-glucose 4'-epimerase for the conversion of UDP-Glc to UDP-Gal and subsequent incorporation of galactose into glycoconjugates via UDP-Gal-dependent galactosyltransferases. In this paper, we describe the cloning of T. brucei galE, encoding T. brucei UDP-Glc-4'-epimerase, and functional characterization by complementation of a galE-deficient Escherichia coli mutant and enzymatic assay of recombinant protein. A tetracycline-inducible conditional galE null mutant of T. brucei was created using a transgenic parasite expressing the TETR tetracycline repressor protein gene. Withdrawal of tetracycline led to a cessation of cell division and substantial cell death, demonstrating that galactose metabolism in T. brucei proceeds via UDP-Glc-4'-epimerase and is essential for parasite growth. After several days without tetracycline, cultures spontaneously recovered. These cells were shown to have undergone a genetic rearrangement that deleted the TETR gene. The results show that enzymes and transporters involved in galactose metabolism may be considered as potential therapeutic targets against African trypanosomiasis."
51,Triazinyl derivatives that are potent inhibitors of glucose transport in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1007/s004360100473,2001-12-01,[],"Glucose transport in Trypanosoma brucei is facilitated by a transporter that is kinetically markedly different from its mammalian homologue. In this regard, the trypanosomal transporter may be selectively targeted. We investigated the potential of a series of triazinyl derivatives as inhibitors of glucose transport in T. brucei. A graded response of glucose transporter inhibition by these compounds was observed, with Cibacron blue 3GA, CiB, being the most potent. This inhibited transport by up to 90% in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 of about 19.4 microM. A Dixon plot of different concentrations of this triazine and the rate of transport suggested that inhibition may be simple and competitive. The inhibition constant Ki was 14.8 microM. Although cytochalasin B has been widely reported to inhibit glucose uptake by mammalian and other eukaryotic glucose transporters, it had no effect at all on the trypanosome transporter at concentrations equivalent to those of the triazines. This may suggest structural differences between the trypanosome and mammalian glucose transporters and also suggests that the triazine moiety may serve as a template for the design potent trypanocides targeted at the glucose transporter."
52,Critical parameters for functional reconstitution of glucose transport in Trypanosoma brucei membrane vesicles.,10.1016/s0005-2736(01)00363-7,2001-07-27,[],"The glucose transporter of Trypanosoma brucei was reconstituted by incorporating Escherichia coli phospholipid liposomes into detergent-solubilised trypanosome membranes. Proteoliposome vesicles were formed by detergent dilution and used in glucose-uptake assays. The minima for functional reconstitution of the glucose transporter were established and used to probe the mechanism of glucose transport. The uptake pattern of radiolabelled glucose showed a counterflow transient at about 3 s, after which the sugar equilibrated across the proteoliposomal membrane. This observation is consistent with a facilitated transporter. There was a six-fold increase in the initial rate of glucose uptake compared to non-reconstituted or native membranes. In addition, the transporter exhibited stereospecificity to D-glucose but poorly transported L-glucose. Directionality, stereoselectivity or substrate specificity and cis-inhibition by phloridzin were therefore the main criteria for validation of glucose transport. The observed counterflow transient also provided further evidence for a facilitated glucose transporter within the trypanosome plasma membrane, and was the single most important criterion for this assertion. A stoichiometry of 0.78 mol of glucose per mol of transporter was estimated."
53,Trypanosoma brucei brucei crosses the blood-brain barrier while tight junction proteins are preserved in a rat chronic disease model.,10.1046/j.0305-1846.2001.00306.x,2001-04-12,[],"African trypanosomiasis, sleeping sickness in humans, is caused by the systemic infection of the host by the extracellular parasite, the African trypanosome. The pathogenetic mechanisms of the severe symptoms of central nervous system involvement are still not well understood. The present study examined the routes of haematogenous spread of Trypanosoma brucei brucei (Tbb) to the brain, in particular on the question whether parasites can cross the blood-brain barrier, as well as their effect on tight junction proteins. Rats were infected with Tbb and at various times post-infection, the location of the parasite in the central nervous system was examined in relation to the brain vascular endothelium, visualized with an anti-glucose transporter-1 antibody. The tight junction-specific proteins occludin and zonula occludens 1, and the possible activation of the endothelial cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were also studied. At 12 and 22 days post-infection, the large majority of parasites were confined within blood vessels. At this stage, however, some parasites were also clearly observed in the brain parenchyma. This was accompanied by an upregulation of ICAM-1/VCAM-1. At later stages, 42, 45 and 55 days post-infection, parasites could still be detected within or in association with blood vessels. In addition, the parasite was now frequently found in the brain parenchyma and the extravasation of parasites was more prominent in the white matter than the cerebral cortex. A marked penetration of parasites was seen in the septal nuclei. In spite of this, occludin and zonula occludens 1 staining of the vessels was preserved. The results indicate that the Tbb parasite is able to cross the blood-brain barrier in vivo, without a generalized loss of tight junction proteins."
54,"Characterization and disruption of a new Trypanosoma brucei repetitive flagellum protein, using double-stranded RNA inhibition.",10.1016/s0166-6851(00)00319-4,2001-02-13,[],"In Trypanosoma brucei, we have cloned a gene approximately 5 kb downstream of the glucose transporter gene cluster, containing a variable number of 102 bp repeats. This gene encodes a protein with no homologues in the data bases. Antibodies raised against the 34 amino acids repeated motif recognized proteins ranging from 145 to 270 kDa, depending on strains, in both bloodstream and procyclic forms of T. brucei. A correlation was established between the apparent molecular mass of the detected proteins and the number of 34 amino acid repeats which varies from 3 to 40. We have called this protein the flagellum transition zone component (FTZC) due to its localization to the proximal region of the axoneme, within the transition zone. FTZC is the only reported example of a trypanosomal protein present in the transition zone. To determine the role of FTZC we developed a new strategy of gene inactivation based on conditional expression of double-stranded RNA. In the presence of tetracycline, expression of the double-stranded RNA, we observed a complete disappearance of FTZC in the EATRO 1125 and EATRO 427 strains of T. hrucei. Molecular ablation of FTZC does not generate any obvious phenotype such as, lethality, modification of growth rate or cellular shape, in the growth conditions used."
55,Hexose transport in asexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum and kinetoplastidae.,10.1016/s0169-4758(00)01762-2,2000-12-21,[],"The hexose sugar, glucose, is a vital energy source for most organisms and an essential nutrient for asexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum. Kinetoplastid organisms (e.g. Trypanosoma and Leishmania spp) also require glucose at certain critical stages of their life cycles. Although phylogenetically unrelated, these organisms share many common challenges during the mammalian stages of a parasitic life cycle, and possess hexose uptake mechanisms that are amenable to study using similar methods. Defining hexose permeation pathways into parasites might expose an Achilles' heel at which both antidisease and antiparasite measures can be aimed. Understanding the mode of entry of glucose also presents a good general model for substrate acquisition in multicompartment systems. In this review, Sanjeev Krishna and colleagues summarize current understanding of hexose transport processes in P. falciparum and provide a comparison with data obtained from kinetoplastids."
56,The structure-function relationship of functionally distinct but structurally similar hexose transporters from Trypanosoma congolense.,10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01543.x,2000-07-21,[],"We have previously characterized, in Trypanosoma brucei, a multigene family encoding two developmentally regulated glucose transporters that are 80% identical at the amino-acid level. We report here the characterization of the homologous glucose transporters (TcoHT1 and TcoHT2) in Trypanosoma congolense, an African trypanosome responsible for disease in domestic animals. Both TcoHT isoforms, which are 92.4% identical, are encoded by a single cluster of genes containing two copies of TcoHT1 and three copies of TcoHT2 arranged alternately. Northern blot analysis revealed that TcoHT2 is expressed in all of the adaptive forms, while mRNA encoding TcoHT1 is only present in the metacyclic and bloodstream forms of T. congolense. When transfected with the TcoHT2 gene, Chinese Hamster Ovary cells express a hexose transporter with properties similar to those of the T. congolense procyclic forms (Km D-glucose = 41 microM versus 64 microM). In contrast to TcoHT2, TcoHT1 expressed in the Chinese hamster ovary cells appeared to be a relatively low affinity glucose transporter (Ki D-glucose = 0.8 mM). To determine the region(s) involved in the different apparent affinities for glucose, a chimera analysis was undertaken on the TcoHT isoforms. This study shows that amino-acid residues important for D-glucose recognition are located in the central region (between transmembrane domains 3 and 7) and in the C-terminal intracellular domain of TcoHT2. Site directed mutagenesis identified Ser193 located within transmembrane helix 4 as a key residue in relaxing the apparent affinity of TcoHT1 for glucose."
57,Factors that determine the plasma-membrane potential in bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01477.x,2000-07-21,[],"The plasma-membrane potential (Delta(psi)p) in bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei was studied using several different radiolabelled probes: 86Rb+ and [14C]SCN- were used to report Delta(psi)p directly because they distribute in easily measured quantities across the plasma membrane only, and [3H]methyltriphenylphosphonium (MePh3P+) was used to report Delta(psi)p only when Delta(psi)m had been abolished with FCCP because it reports the algebraic sum of the two potentials when used alone. The unperturbed Delta(psi)p had a value of -82 mV and was found to be essentially identical with, and determined almost completely by, the potassium diffusion potential, as evidenced by: (a) the lack of effect of valinomycin on the value obtained under appropriate conditions when any of these probes were used; (b) the close agreement of this measured value with that predicted from the measured distribution of K+ across the plasma membrane (-76 mV); (c) the large effect of changes in the extracellular K+ concentration by substitution with Na+ on Delta(psi)p together with the complete lack of effect of substitution of extracellular Na+ by the choline cation or substitution of extracellular Cl- by the gluconate anion on Delta(psi)p. The contribution to Delta(psi)p by electrogenic pumping of Na+/K+-ATPase was found to be small (of the order of 6 mV). H+ was not found to be pumped across the plasma membrane or to contribute to Delta(psi)p."
58,"Hydrogen ion gradients across the mitochondrial, endosomal and plasma membranes in bloodstream forms of trypanosoma brucei solving the three-compartment problem.",10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01476.x,2000-07-21,[],"Conditions for the use of both [14C]methylamine and 5, 5-dimethyl[14C]oxa-azolidine-2,4-dione (DMO) to measure the H+ concentration of intracellular compartments of monomorphic long thin bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei were established. Neither probe was actively transported or bound to internal components of the cell and both probes equilibrated passively with a t1/2 close to 8 min. DMO was excluded from cells, while methylamine was accumulated but not metabolized. Solution of the three-compartment problem revealed that, when cells were respiring aerobically on glucose at an external pH of 7.5, the cytoplasmic pH was in the range 6.99-7.03, the pH of the mitochondrial matrix was 7.71-7.73, and the algebraic average pH of the various endosomal compartments was 5.19-5.50. Similar values were found when cells were respiring aerobically on glycerol. However, bloodstream forms of T. brucei could not maintain a constant internal H+ concentration outside the external pH range 7.0-7.5, and no evidence for the presence of an H+/Na+ exchanger was found. Full motility and levels of pyruvate production were maintained as the external pH was raised as high as 9.5, suggesting that these cells tolerate significant internal alkalinisation. However, both motility and pyruvate production were severely inhibited under acidic conditions, and the cells deteriorated rapidly below an external pH of 6.5. Physiologically, the plasma membrane of T. brucei had low permeability to H+ and the internal pH was unaffected by changes in Deltapsip, which is dominated by the potassium diffusion potential. However, in the presence of FCCP, the internal pH fell rapidly about 0.5 pH unit and came into equilibrium with Deltapsip. Oligomycin abolished the mitochondrial pH gradient (DeltapHm) selectively, whereas chloroquine abolished only the endosomal pH gradient (DeltapHe). The pH gradient across the plasma membrane (DeltapHp) alone could be abolished by careful osmotic swelling of cells. The plasma membrane had an inwardly directed proton-motive force (DeltaPp) of -52 mV and an inwardly directed sodium-motive force (DeltaNp) of -149 mV, whereas the mitochondrial inner membrane had only an inwardly directed DeltaPm of -195 mV. The pH gradient across the endosomal membranes was not accompanied by an electrical gradient. Consequently, endosomal membranes had an algebraically average outwardly directed DeltaPl within the range + 89 to +110 mV, depending on the measurement method."
59,Chemical and enzymatic synthesis of fructose analogues as probes for import studies by the hexose transporter in parasites.,10.1016/s0968-0896(00)00018-3,2000-05-20,[],"Various D-fructose analogues modified at C-1 or C-6 positions were synthesized from D-glucose by taking advantage of the Amadori rearrangement or using the aldol condensation between dihydroxyacetone phosphate and appropriate aldehyde catalyzed by fructose 1,6-diphosphate aldolase from rabbit muscle. The affinities of the analogues for the glucose transporter expressed in the mammalian form of Trypanosoma brucei were determined by inhibition of radiolabelled 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DOG) transport using zero-trans kinetic analysis. Interestingly, the analogues bearing an aromatic group (i.e. a fluorescence marker) at C-1 or C-6 positions present comparable apparent affinities to D-fructose for the transporter. This result could find applications for hexose transport studies and also provides criteria for the design of glucose import inhibitors."
60,Complementation of a glucose transporter mutant of Schizosaccharomyces pombe by a novel Trypanosoma brucei gene.,10.1074/jbc.275.19.14217,2000-05-09,[],"The African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei has a digenetic life cycle that involves the insect vector and the mammalian host. This is underscored by biochemical switches in its nutritional requirements. In the insect vector, the parasite relies on amino acid catabolism, but in the mammalian host, it derives its energy exclusively from blood glucose. Glucose transport is facilitated, and constitutes the rate-limiting step in ATP synthesis. Here, we report the cloning of a novel glucose transporter-related gene by heterologous screening of a lambdaEMBL4 genomic library of T. brucei EATRO 164 using a rat liver glucose transporter cDNA clone. Genomic analysis shows that the gene is present as a single copy within the parasite genome. The gene encodes a protein with an estimated molecular mass of 55.9 kDa, which shares only segmental homology with members of the glucose transporter superfamily. Several potential post-translational modification sites including phosphorylation, N-glycosylation, and cotranslational myristoylation sites also punctuate the sequence. It is distinguished from classical transporter proteins by the absence of putative hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains. However, this protein was capable of complementing Schizosaccharomyces pombe glucose transporter mutants. The rescued phenotype conferred the ability of the cells to grow on a broad range of sugars, both monosaccharides and disaccharides. The kinetics of glucose uptake reflected those in T. brucei. In addition to complementation in yeast, we also showed that the gene enhanced glucose uptake in cultured mammalian cells."
61,Metabolic control analysis of glycolysis in trypanosomes as an approach to improve selectivity and effectiveness of drugs.,10.1016/s0166-6851(99)00197-8,2000-04-01,[],"Glycolysis is the only ATP-generating process in bloodstream form trypanosomes and is therefore a promising drug target. Inhibitors which decrease significantly the glycolytic flux will kill the parasites. Both computer simulation and experimental studies of glycolysis in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei indicated that the control of the glycolytic flux is shared by several steps in the pathway. The results of these analyses provide quantitative information about the prospects of decreasing the flux by inhibition of any individual enzyme. The plasma membrane glucose transporter appears the most promising target from this perspective, followed by aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Non-competitive or irreversible inhibitors would be most effective, but it is argued that potent competitive inhibitors can be suitable, provided that the concentration of the competing substrate cannot increase unrestrictedly. Such is the case for inhibitors that compete with coenzymes or with blood glucose."
63,Contribution of glucose transport to the control of the glycolytic flux in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1073/pnas.96.18.10098,1999-09-01,[],"The rate of glucose transport across the plasma membrane of the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei was modulated by titration of the hexose transporter with the inhibitor phloretin, and the effect on the glycolytic flux was measured. A rapid glucose uptake assay was developed to measure the transport activity independently of the glycolytic flux. Phloretin proved a competitive inhibitor. When the effect of the intracellular glucose concentration on the inhibition was taken into account, the flux control coefficient of the glucose transporter was between 0.3 and 0.5 at 5 mM glucose. Because the flux control coefficients of all steps in a metabolic pathway sum to 1, this result proves that glucose transport is not the rate-limiting step of trypanosome glycolysis. Under physiological conditions, transport shares the control with other steps. At glucose concentrations much lower than physiological, the glucose carrier assumed all control, in close agreement with model predictions."
64,"An easy stereospecific synthesis of 1-amino-2,5-anhydro-1-deoxy-D-mannitol and arylamino derivatives.",10.1016/s0008-6215(99)00040-3,1999-07-10,[],"1-Amino-2,5-anhydro-1-deoxy-D-mannitol and a series of arylamino derivatives were prepared by nitrous acid deamination of 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose and subsequent reductive amination of the resulting 2,5-anhydro-D-mannose. Some of these compounds showed an enhanced affinity for the hexose transporter of Trypanosoma brucei as compared to D-fructose."
65,What controls glycolysis in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei?,10.1074/jbc.274.21.14551,1999-05-18,[],"On the basis of the experimentally determined kinetic properties of the trypanosomal enzymes, the question is addressed of which step limits the glycolytic flux in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei. There appeared to be no single answer; in the physiological range, control shifted between the glucose transporter on the one hand and aldolase (ALD), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDH) on the other hand. The other kinases, which are often thought to control glycolysis, exerted little control; so did the utilization of ATP. We identified potential targets for anti-trypanosomal drugs by calculating which steps need the least inhibition to achieve a certain inhibition of the glycolytic flux in these parasites. The glucose transporter appeared to be the most promising target, followed by ALD, GDH, GAPDH, and PGK. By contrast, in erythrocytes more than 95% deficiencies of PGK, GAPDH, or ALD did not cause any clinical symptoms (Schuster, R. and Holzhütter, H.-G. (1995) Eur. J. Biochem. 229, 403-418). Therefore, the selectivity of drugs inhibiting these enzymes may be much higher than expected from their molecular effects alone. Quite unexpectedly, trypanosomes seem to possess a substantial overcapacity of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase, making these ""irreversible"" enzymes mediocre drug targets."
66,Surface receptors and transporters of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1146/annurev.micro.52.1.745,1999-01-19,[],"African trypanosomes combine antigenic variation of their surface coat with the ability to take up nutrients from their mammalian hosts. Uptake of small molecules such as glucose or nucleosides is mediated by translocators hidden from host antibodies by the surface coat. The multiple glucose transporters and transporters for nucleobases and nucleosides have been characterized. Receptors for host macromolecules such as transferrin and lipoproteins are visible to antibodies but hidden from the cellular arm of the host immune system in an invagination of the trypanosome surface, the flagellar pocket. The trypanosomal transferrin receptor is a heterodimer that resembles the major component of the surface coat of Trypanosoma brucei. The ability to make several versions of this receptor allows T. brucei to bind transferrins from a range of mammals with high affinity. The proteins required for uptake of nutrients by trypanosomes provide a target for chemotherapy that remains to be fully exploited."
67,Conserved organization of genes in trypanosomatids.,10.1016/s0166-6851(98)00080-2,1998-09-25,[],"Trypanosomatids are unicellular protozoan parasites which constitute some of the most primitive eukaryotes. Leishmania spp, Trypanosoma cruzi and members of the Trypanosoma brucei group, which cause human diseases, are the most studied representatives of this large family. Here we report a comparative analysis of a large genomic region containing glucose transporter genes in three Salivarian trypanosomes (T. brucei, T. congolense and T. vivax), T. cruzi and Leishmania donovani. In T. brucei, the 8 kb (upstream) and 14 kb (downstream) regions flanking the glucose transporter genes cluster contain two and six new genes, respectively, six of them encoding proteins homologous to known eukaryotic proteins (phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, ribosomal protein S12, DNAJ and three small G-proteins--Rab1, YPT6 and ARL3). This gene organization is identical in T. brucei, T. congolense and T. vivax suggesting that Salivarian trypanosomes have a high level of conservation in gene organization. In T. cruzi and Leishmania, the overall organization of this cluster is conserved, with insertion of additional genes when compared with T. brucei. Phylogenetic reconstitution based on glucose transporters is in accord with the monophyly of the genus Trypanosoma and the early separation of T. vivax within Salivarian trypanosomes. On the basis of gene organization, biochemical characteristics of isoforms and phylogeny, we discuss the genesis of the glucose transporter multigene family in Salivarian trypanosomes."
69,"Prospects for antiparasitic drugs. The case of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness.",10.1074/jbc.273.10.5500,1998-04-16,[],"Glycolysis in the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei provides a convenient context for studying the prospects for using enzyme inhibitors as antiparasitic drugs. As the recently developed model of this system (Bakker, B. M., Michels, P. A. M., Opperdoes, F. R., and Westerhoff, H. V. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 3207-3215) contains 20 enzyme-catalyzed reactions or transport steps, there are apparently numerous potential targets for drugs. However, as most flux control resides in the glucose-transport step, this is the only step for which inhibition can be expected to produce large effects on flux, and in the computer model such effects prove to be surprisingly small (although larger than those obtained by inhibiting any other step). It follows that there is little prospect of killing trypanosomes by depressing their glycolysis to a level incapable of sustaining life. The alternative is to use inhibition to increase the concentration of a metabolite sufficiently to interfere with the viability of the organism. For this purpose, only uncompetitive inhibition of pyruvate export proves effective in the model; in all other cases studied, the effects on metabolite concentrations are little more than trivial. This observation can be explained by the fact that nearly all of the metabolite concentrations in the system are held within relatively narrow ranges by stoichiometric constraints."
70,Kinetoplastid glucose transporters.,10.1042/bj3250569,1997-08-01,[],"Protozoa of the order kinetoplastida have colonized many habitats, and several species are important parasites of humans. Adaptation to different environments requires an associated adaptation at a cell's interface with its environment, i.e. the plasma membrane. Sugar transport by the kinetoplastida as a phylogenetically related group of organisms offers an exceptional model in which to study the ways by which the carrier proteins involved in this process may evolve to meet differing environmental challenges. Seven genes encoding proteins involved in glucose transport have been cloned from several kinetoplastid species. The transporters all belong to the glucose transporter superfamily exemplified by the mammalian erythrocyte transporter GLUT1. Some species, such as the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei, which undergo a life cycle where the parasites are exposed to very different glucose concentrations in the mammalian bloodstream and tsetse-fly midgut, have evolved two different transporters to deal with this fluctuation. Other species, such as the South American trypanosome Trypanosoma cruzi, multiply predominantly in conditions of relative glucose deprivation (intracellularly in the mammalian host, or within the reduviid bug midgut) and have a single, relatively high-affinity type, transporter. All of the kinetoplastid transporters can also transport d-fructose, and are relatively insensitive to the classical inhibitors of GLUT1 transport cytochalasin B and phloretin."
71,Intraclonal mating in Trypanosoma brucei is associated with out-crossing.,10.1099/00221287-143-3-909,1997-03-01,[],"To examine whether mating can occur within as well as between clones of Trypanosoma brucei, we transformed three T. brucei subspecies stocks with heterologous genes conferring resistance to either hygromycin or Geneticin and carried out a series of inter- and intraclone matings in all possible double drug combinations. Double drug-resistant hybrids were recovered from three of the six out-crosses, but not from any of the three intraclone matings. However, further analysis of cloned progeny trypanosomes from one of the out-crosses using RFLP markers, molecular karyotyping and RAPD (random amplification of polymorphic DNA) produced unequivocal evidence that intra- as well as interclone mating had occurred. The progeny of interclone mating were double drug-resistant and heterozygous at 9 of 13 loci examined. In contrast, the progeny of intraclone mating had no demonstrable input of genetic material from the hygromycin-resistant parent and were similar to the Geneticin-resistant parent for most markers, except for five loci which were heterozygous in the Geneticin-resistant parent but homozygous in these clones (aldolase THT1 glucose transporter, procyclin, tubulin and cDNA 23). In addition, PFGE showed considerable karyotypic rearrangements in these clones and loss of genetic material was evident from RAPD and VSG (variant surface glycoprotein) gene fingerprint analysis. We conclude that intraclone mating can occur in trypanosomes, but only during out-crossing, suggesting that meiosis and/or fusion are triggered by a diffusible factor."
72,Glycolysis in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei can be understood in terms of the kinetics of the glycolytic enzymes.,10.1074/jbc.272.6.3207,1997-02-07,[],"In trypanosomes the first part of glycolysis takes place in specialized microbodies, the glycosomes. Most glycolytic enzymes of Trypanosoma brucei have been purified and characterized kinetically. In this paper a mathematical model of glycolysis in the bloodstream form of this organism is developed on the basis of all available kinetic data. The fluxes and the cytosolic metabolite concentrations as predicted by the model were in accordance with available data as measured in non-growing trypanosomes, both under aerobic and under anaerobic conditions. The model also reproduced the inhibition of anaerobic glycolysis by glycerol, although the amount of glycerol needed to inhibit glycolysis completely was lower than experimentally determined. At low extracellular glucose concentrations the intracellular glucose concentration remained very low, and only at 5 mM of extracellular glucose, free glucose started to accumulate intracellularly, in close agreement with experimental observations. This biphasic relation could be related to the large difference between the affinities of the glucose transporter and hexokinase for intracellular glucose. The calculated intraglycosomal metabolite concentrations demonstrated that enzymes that have been shown to be near-equilibrium in the cytosol must work far from equilibrium in the glycosome in order to maintain the high glycolytic flux in the latter."
73,"An antibiotic, ascofuranone, specifically inhibits respiration and in vitro growth of long slender bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei.",10.1016/s0166-6851(96)02797-1,1997-02-01,[],"Ascofuranone, a prenylphenol antibiotic isolated from a phytopathogenic fungus, Ascochyta visiae, strongly inhibited both glucose-dependent cellular respiration and glycerol-3-phosphate-dependent mitochondrial O2 consumption of long slender bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei. This inhibition was suggested to be due to inhibition of the mitochondrial electron-transport system, composed of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.5) and plant-like alternative oxidase. Ascofuranone noncompetitively inhibited the reduced coenzyme Q1-dependent O2 uptake of the mitochondria with respect to ubiquinol (Ki = 2.38 nM). Therefore, the susceptible site is deduced to be the ubiquinone redox machinery which links the two enzyme activities. Further, ascofuranone in combination with glycerol completely blocked energy production, and potently inhibited the in vitro growth of the parasite. Our findings suggest that ascofuranone might be a promising candidate for the chemotherapeutic agents of African trypanosomiasis."
74,"Rapid uptake and phosphorylation of D-mannose, and limited D-mannose 6-phosphate isomerization in the glycolytic pathway of bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense.",10.2739/kurumemedj.44.105,1997-01-01,[],"Bloodstream forms of the parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma brucei gambiense derive all of needed energy through an unusual glycolysis. In an earlier study, we showed that D-mannose specifically inhibited the growth of bloodstream forms of T. b. gambiense. We investigated D-mannose transport into the T. b. gambiense bloodstream forms and its metabolism in the initial phase of the glycolytic pathway. D-Mannose was transported rapidly into the bloodstream forms of T. b. gambiense (K(m) = 378 microM), and D-glucose competitively inhibited D-mannose uptake. D-Mannose and D-glucose are transported into bloodstream trypanosomes by the same carrier. Hexokinase from the bloodstream trypanosomes could convert D-mannose to D-mannose 6-phosphate (K(m) = 155.8 microM; Vmax = 0.93 mumol/min/mg protein); with kinetic properties very similar to D-glucose phosphorylation (K(m) = 199.4 microM; Vmax = 1.15 mumol/min/mg protein). D-Mannose 6-phosphate could be further metabolized in the glycolytic pathway. However, the metabolic rate was extremely slow, and D-mannose 6-phosphate accumulated in the glycosomes. D-Mannose may cause growth inhibition of bloodstream trypanosomes through an extremely high concentration of D-mannose 6-phosphate in the glycosomes."
75,The presence of rotenone-sensitive NADH dehydrogenase in the long slender bloodstream and the procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.00888.x,1996-11-01,[],"The mitochondrial electron-transport chain present in the procyclic and long slender bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei was investigated by means of several experimental approaches. The oxidation of proline, glycerol and glucose in procyclic cells was inhibited 80-90% by antimycin A or cyanide, 15-19% by salicylhydroxamic acid, and 30-35% by rotenone. Cytochrom-c-reductase activity, with proline or glycerol 3-phosphate as substrate, in a mitochondrial fraction isolated from these cells was inhibited by antimycin and rotenone, but not by malonate, while cytochrome-c-reductase activity with succinate as substrate was inhibited by antimycin A and malonate, but not by rotenone. In addition, the reduction of dichloroindophenol by NADH was inhibited by rotenone but not by malonate, which suggests that rotenone-sensitive NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) is present in these mitochondria. The presence of three subunits of NADH dehydrogenase was observed in immunoblots of mitochondrial proteins with specific antibodies raised against peptides corresponding to predicted antigenic regions of these proteins, which provides further evidence for the presence of NADH dehydrogenase. In long slender bloodstream forms, the oxidation of glucose or glycerol was inhibited 100% by salicyhydroxamic acid, unaffected by cyanide or antimycin A, and inhibited 40% or 75%, respectively, by rotenone, which suggests that NADH dehydrogenase is present in these cells. In a mitochondrial fraction isolated from the bloodstream forms, oxygen uptake with glycerol 3-phosphate as substrate was inhibited 65% by rotenone. Low levels of rotenone-sensitive NADH-dependent reduction of dichloroindophenol and the presence of subunits 7 and 8 of NADH dehydrogenase provided additional evidence for the presence of NADH dehydrogenase in bloodstream forms of T. brucei."
77,Hexose uptake in Trypanosoma cruzi: structure-activity relationship between substrate and transporter.,10.1042/bj3170353,1996-07-15,[],"The gene encoding a hexose transporter, TcrHt1, from Trypanosoma cruzi has been functionally expressed in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells. Kinetic parameters of the heterologously expressed protein are very similar to those of the transporter identified in T. cruzi epimastigotes, confirming that TcrHT1 is the major transporter functioning in these parasites. A detailed analysis of substrate recognition using analogues of D-glucose substituted at each carbon position has been performed. The glucose transporter of T. cruzi does not recognize C-3 or C-6 analogues of D-glucose, whereas these analogues were recognized by the glucose transporter of bloodstream-form T. brucei. As for other kinetoplastid transporters, but in stark contrast to the mammalian GLUT family, TcrHT1 can also transport D-fructose, with relatively high affinity (Km = 0.682 +/- 0.003 mM). Amino acid side-chain-modifying reagents were also used to identify residues of the transporter present at the substrate-binding site. While specific modifiers of cysteine, histidine and arginine all inhibited catalytic activity, protection using substrate was only observed using the arginine-specific reagent, phenylglyoxal. Reagents which modify lysine residues had no effect on transport."
78,Glucose uptake in Trypanosoma vivax and molecular characterization of its transporter gene.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0234n.x,1996-04-01,[],"A gene, TvHT1, encoding a glucose transporter protein, has been cloned from the haemoflagellate protozoon, Trypanosoma vivax, which has an active Kreb's cycle in the mammalian stage. The deduced polypeptide is similar in amino acid sequence to other kinetoplastid hexose transporters from Trypanosoma brucei (THT1 and THT2), Trypanosoma cruzi (TcrHT1) and Leishmania (Pro-1). The similarity is higher with THT2 (expressed in T. brucei insect forms) than with the other isoforms. The kinetic properties of glucose uptake in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells expressing TvHT1 and in trypanosomes show s a saturable transport mechanism typical of a facilitated carrier system, with a similar affinity for D-glucose as that of the T. brucei bloodstream form carrier, THT1 (Km = 0.548 +/- 0.01 mM, Vmax = 4.26 +/- 0.12 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1 in CHO cells and Km = 0.585 +/- 0.068 mM, Vmax = 88.5 +/- 6.2 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1 in T. vivax). The specificity of the TvHT1 protein for various D-glucose analogues, as judged by inhibition of 2-deoxy-D-arabinose-hexose transport, shows properties that are intermediate between those of THT1 on the one hand and TcrHT1 and THT2 on the other. As with the hexose transporters in the other members of Kinetoplastida, the TvHT1-encoded system differs from erythrocyte-type glucose transport by its moderate sensitivity to cytochalasin B and its capacity to transport fructose."
79,Glucose uptake occurs by facilitated diffusion in procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.00228.x,1996-02-15,[],"The glucose transporter of Trypanosoma brucei procyclic forms was characterized and compared with its bloodstream form counterpart. Measuring the glucose consumption enzymatically, we determined a saturable uptake process of relatively high affinity (Km = 80 microM, Vmax = 4 nmol min-1 10(-8) cells), which showed substrate inhibition at glucose concentrations above 1.5 mM (Ki = 21 mM). Control experiments measuring deoxy-D-[3H]Glc uptake under zero-trans conditions indicated that substrate inhibition occurred on the level of glycolysis. Temperature-dependent kinetics revealed a temperature quotient of Q10 = 2.33 and an activation energy of Ea = 64 kJ mol-1. As shown by trans-stimulation experiments, glucose uptake was stereospecific for the D isomer, whereas L-glucose was not recognized. Inhibitor studies using either the uncoupler carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (5 microM), the H+/ATPase inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (20 microM), the ionophor monensin (1 microM), or the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain (1 mM) showed insignificant effects on transport efficiency. The procyclic glucose transporter was subsequently enriched in a plasma-membrane fraction and functionally reconstituted into proteoliposomes. Using Na+-free conditions in the absence of a proton gradient, the specific activity of D-[14C]glucose transport was determined as 2.9 nmol min-1 (mg protein)-1 at 0.2 mM glucose. From these cumulative results, we conclude that glucose uptake by the procyclic insect form of the parasite occurs by facilitated diffusion, similar to the hexose-transport system expressed in bloodstream forms. However, the markedly higher substrate affinity indicates a differential expression of different transporter isoforms throughout the lifecycle."
80,"Functional expression and characterization of the Trypanosoma brucei procyclic glucose transporter, THT2.",10.1042/bj3120687,1995-12-15,[],"The gene encoding THT2, one of two hexose-transporter isoforms present in Trypanosoma brucei, has been expressed in both Xenopus laevis oocytes and a stably transfected line of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The heterologously expressed gene encodes a protein with pharmacological and kinetic parameters similar to those of the hexose transporter measured in procyclic-culture-form trypanosomes. The substrate recognition of the THT2 transporter differed from that of the THT1 isoform, which is expressed only in bloodstream forms, in that: (i) it has a relatively high affinity for substrate with a Km of 59 microM for 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DOG) and a similar high affinity for D-glucose (compared with Km of 0.5 mM for 2-DOG in bloodstream forms); (ii) the affinity for 6-deoxy-D-glucose (6-DOG) is two orders of magnitude lower than that for D-glucose, whereas the bloodstream-form transporter recognizes D-glucose and its 6-DOG analogue with similar affinity; (iii) the bloodstream-form transporter, but not THT2, recognizes 3-fluoro-3-deoxy-D-glucose. D-Fructose-transport capacity and insensitivity to D-galactose was also found in THT2-expressing CHO cells and procyclic trypanosomes. We conclude from these cumulative results that the THT2 gene encodes the transporter responsible for hexose transport in procyclic trypanosomes. The transport of 2-DOG in procyclic organisms was inhibited by both the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone (FCCP), and KCN, suggesting a requirement for a protonmotive force. However, sensitivity to these reagents depended on the external substrate concentration, with uptake being unaffected at substrate concentrations higher than 2 mM. THT2 expressed in CHO cells behaved as a facilitated transporter, and was unaffected by FCCP or KCN over the whole substrate concentration range tested."
81,Regulation and control of compartmentalized glycolysis in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1007/BF02110191,1995-10-01,[],"Unlike other eukaryotic cells, trypanosomes possess a compartmentalized glycolytic pathway. The conversion of glucose into 3-phosphoglycerate takes place in specialized peroxisomes, called glycosomes. Further conversion of this intermediate into pyruvate occurs in the cytosol. Due to this compartmentation, many regulatory mechanisms operating in other cell types cannot work in trypanosomes. This is reflected by the insensitivity of the glycosomal enzymes to compounds that act as activity regulators in other cell types. Several speculations have been raised about the function of compartmentation of glycolysis in trypanosomes. We calculate that even in a noncompartmentalized trypanosome the flux through glycolysis should not be limited by diffusion. Therefore, the sequestration of glycolytic enzymes in an organelle may not serve to overcome a diffusion limitation. We also search the available data for a possible relation between compartmentation and the distribution of control of the glycolytic flux among the glycolytic enzymes. Under physiological conditions, the rate of glycolytic ATP production in the bloodstream form of the parasite is possibly controlled by the oxygen tension, but not by the glucose concentration. Within the framework of Metabolic Control Analysis, we discuss evidence that glucose transport, although it does not qualify as the sole rate-limiting step, does have a high flux control coefficient. This, however, does not distinguish trypanosomes from other eukaryotic cell types without glycosomes."
82,Oligomycin-sensitivity of hexose-sugar catabolism in the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1111/j.1470-8744.1994.tb00322.x,1994-12-01,[],"The catabolism of hexose sugars and glycerol by the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei brucei incubated with oligomycin was investigated. Oligomycin at a concentration of 10 micrograms/10(8) trypanosomes inhibited the catabolism of fructose, glucose and mannose by 70-80%, but not that of glycerol. Permeabilization of the trypanosome membranes by digitonin did not reverse the inhibition by oligomycin. Oligomycin did not inhibit pyruvate production in digitonin-permeabilized trypanosomes which were catabolizing exogenous glycolytic intermediates. It is concluded that the oligomycin-sensitive glycolysis is dependent on trypanosome membrane integrity. Oligomycin caused a rapid increase in the levels of hexose phosphates and some triose phosphates, but a decrease in the levels of glycerate 2-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate. There was a crossover point in the sequence of reactions between the formation of glycerol 3-phosphate and glycerate 2-phosphate during catabolism of the hexoses. Addition of the same concentration of oligomycin caused no change in the levels of glycolytic intermediates during the catabolism of glycerol. It is proposed that the catabolism of hexose sugars requires the transport of glycerol 3-phosphate from the glycosome via a glycerol 3-phosphate carrier which is probably inhibited by a hexose-sugar derivative formed on inhibition of the mitochondrial Mg(2+)-ATPase by oligomycin."
83,Characterization of glucose transport and cloning of a hexose transporter gene in Trypanosoma cruzi.,10.1073/pnas.91.17.8278,1994-08-16,[],"A gene from Trypanosoma cruzi, TcrHT1, which encodes a member of the glucose transporter superfamily has been cloned. The gene is similar in sequence to the T. brucei hexose transporter THT1 and the Leishmania transporter Pro-1 and is present in the T. cruzi genome as a cluster of at least eight tandemly reiterated copies. Northern blot analysis revealed two mRNA transcripts which differ in size with respect to their 3' untranslated regions. When injected with in vitro transcribed TcrHT1 mRNA, Xenopus oocytes express a hexose transporter with properties similar to those of T. cruzi. Glucose transport in T. cruzi is mediated via a carrier with unique properties when compared with the other glucose transporters already characterized among the Kinetoplastida. It is a facilitated transporter with a high affinity for D-glucose (Km = 84.1 +/- 7.9 microM and Vmax = 46 +/- 9.4 nmol/min per mg of protein) that shares with other kinetoplastid hexose transporters the ability to recognize D-fructose, which distinguishes these carriers from the human erythrocyte glucose transporter GLUT1."
84,Alteration of pyruvate metabolism in African trypanosomes during differentiation from bloodstream into insect forms.,10.1006/abbi.1994.1361,1994-08-15,[],"In the presence of glucose and ample oxygen, insect form African trypanosomes release pyruvate more than 100-fold more slowly than do bloodstream forms. This rate decrease could not be accounted for simply by an increased mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation rate as inhibiting mitochondrial respiration increases pyruvate efflux to rates only 2-3% of that observed for bloodstream form trypanosomes. Alternatively, decreased pyruvate efflux from insect form trypanosomes could not be accounted for by decreased pyruvate transporter activity, which, surprisingly, was nearly as high in insect form trypanosomes as reported by us earlier for bloodstream forms (J.P. Barnard, B. Reynafarje, and P.L. Pedersen (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 3654-3661). Rather, the low pyruvate efflux rate appears to be due primarily to reduced levels of the enzyme pyruvate kinase, which, in contrast to conclusions of an earlier study, is readily detected in insect form trypanosomes in the absence of added activators at an activity level about 4% of that found in bloodstream forms. Insect form pyruvate kinase seems to be located in the cytosol and exhibits kinetic profiles and constants nearly identical to those reported by us earlier for the bloodstream form enzyme (J.P. Barnard, and P.L. Pedersen (1988) Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 31, 141-148). It is suggested that the reduced levels of pyruvate kinase, and hence the reduced pyruvate efflux rates, in insect form trypanosomes result from down regulation of the gene encoding the cytosolic enzyme."
85,Membrane-related processes and overall energy metabolism in Trypanosoma brucei and other kinetoplastid species.,10.1007/BF00763065,1994-04-01,[],"An electrochemical proton gradient exists across the plasma membrane and the mitochondrial membrane of the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei. The membrane potential across the plasma membrane and the regulation of the internal pH depend on the temperature. Leishmania donovani regulates its internal pH and maintains a constant electrochemical proton gradient across its plasma membrane under all conditions examined. The mitochondrion of the T. brucei bloodstream form is energized, even though the reactions taking place in it do not result in net ATP synthesis and the Kreb's cycle and the respiratory chain are absent. Glucose is transported across the plasma membrane of T. brucei by a facilitated diffusion carrier, that can transport a wider range of substrates than its mammalian counterparts. Pyruvate exits the cell via a facilitated diffusion transporter as well. Conflicting evidence exists for the mechanism of glucose transport in L. donovani; biochemical evidence suggests proton/glucose symport, while facilitated diffusion is indicated by physiological data."
86,African trypanosome glucose transporter genes: organization and evolution of a multigene family.,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040104,1994-03-01,[],"Trypanosoma brucei brucei (EATRO-164) contains a tandem array of six genes encoding a glucose transporter, THT1 (trypanosome hexose transporter), followed by five genes encoding a second isoform, THT2. Two distinct clusters containing THT1 and THT2 genes have been identified in the EATRO-164 clone and in most other African trypanosome clones analyzed. Analysis of progeny from crosses between clones of T. b. brucei displaying polymorphism in THT1 copy number per cluster suggests that the two clusters of THT genes are present on homologous chromosomes. In addition, analysis of 30 African trypanosome clones revealed a high degree of polymorphism in THT1 copy number per cluster. Sequence comparison of five THT1 and two and one-half THT2 unit repeats, present within a 20-kb region, provided information about the genesis and evolution of the THT multigene family. The most divergent regions between THT1 and THT2 unit repeats probably arose from insertion of DNA fragments into an ancestral THT region. Genes of each of the different families are almost identical, and there are large regions of identity shared between THT1 and THT2 members. A mosaic copy containing most of a THT1 gene with the 3' extremity of a THT2 gene is found within the cluster. These results suggest that THT1 and THT2 arose by modification (insertion, mutation, or conversion) of duplicated ancestral genes. Functional constraints and homologous recombination may be evoked to explain the maintenance of the conserved sequences of THT1 and THT2."
87,Oxidation of NADH by a rotenone and antimycin-sensitive pathway in the mitochondrion of procyclic Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(94)90137-6,1994-03-01,[],"The pathway of NADH oxidation in the procyclic Trypanosoma brucei brucei was investigated in a crude mitochondrial membrane fraction and in whole cells permeabilized with digitonin. NADH:cytochrome c reductase activity was 75% inhibited by concentrations of antimycin that inhibited 95% succinate:cytochrome c reductase activity suggesting that the major pathway for NADH oxidation in the mitochondria involved the cytochrome bc1 complex of the electron transfer chain. Both NADH:cytochrome c and NADH:ubiquinone reductase activities were inhibited 80-90% by rotenone indicating the presence of a complex I-like NADH dehydrogenase in the mitochondrion of trypanosomes. In whole cells permeabilized with low concentrations of digitonin, the oxidation of malate, proline and glucose (in the presence of salicylhydroxamic acid, the inhibitor of the alternate oxidase) was inhibited 30-50% by rotenone. The presence of an alternative pathway for NADH oxidation involving fumarate reductase was indicated by the observation that malonate, the specific inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, inhibited 30-35% the rate of oxygen uptake with malate and glucose as substrates in the digitonin-permeabilized cells. We conclude that in the mitochondrion of the procyclic form of T. brucei, NADH is preferentially oxidized by a rotenone-sensitive NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase; however, NADH can also be oxidized to some extent by the enzyme fumarate reductase present in the mitochondrion of T. brucei."
88,Transport of D-fructose and its analogues by Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(93)90023-q,1993-07-01,[],"Kinetic parameters for entry of D-fructose into Trypanosoma brucei brucei have been determined. The net uptake of D-fructose was found to be rapid and occurred at a rate which was comparable with that observed for uptake of D-glucose. The Km and Vmax were 3.91 +/- 1.58 mM and 69.1 +/- 7.2 nmol min-1 (mg protein)-1. D-Fructose was metabolized to pyruvate under aerobic conditions and to pyruvate and glycerol under anaerobic conditions in a manner similar to D-glucose. Comparisons of the kinetic parameters for D-fructose transport and metabolism indicated that uptake was rate limiting. Inhibition constants (Ki) for inhibition of 6-deoxy-D-glucose by D-fructose and D-fructose transport by 6-deoxy-D-glucose were consistent with the Km values for these two substrates. These interactions indicate that D-fructose and 6-deoxy-D-glucose share a single common transporter. 1,5-Anhydro-D-glucitol and 1,5 anhydro-D-mannitol (the fused pyranose ring analogues of D-glucose and D-mannose) have been found to interact well with the transporter, while L-sorbose (a D-fructose analogue with a pyranose ring) had only low affinity. However, 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol (a fused furanose ring analogue of D-fructose) inhibited both 6-deoxy-D-glucose and D-fructose transport with a Ki of approx. 0.8 mM. The high affinity for 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol (2-deoxy-D-fructofuranose) indicates that D-fructose is transported in the furanose ring form.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
89,Glucose and proline transport in kinetoplastids.,10.1016/0169-4758(93)90009-5,1993-06-01,[],"The parasitic protozoa belonging to the kinetoplastids can use both sugars and amino acids as carbon and energy sources. In this review, Benno ter Kuile discusses nutrient acquisition and utilization and how the metabolic strategies reflect the environment encountered in host and vector. Recent genetic and physiological evidence suggests that facilitated diffusion may be the primary uptake mechanism for glucose, and possibly for proline as well, even though there is biochemical and genetic evidence suggesting that active transport occurs, if not across the plasma membrane, then across the membranes of organelles. Trypanosoma brucei seems to have a metabolic strategy that strives for maximum energy efficiency, making no storage materials and thereby limiting the control over its internal conditions. On the other hand, Leishmania donovani does create a storage buffer, entrapping glucose in the cell. In this manner, it maintains constant internal conditions at the expense of energy, enabling it to survive more adverse conditions in the macrophage and in its vector."
90,Functional reconstitution of the Trypanosoma brucei plasma-membrane D-glucose transporter.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17958.x,1993-06-01,[],"The D-glucose transporter of Trypanosoma brucei was solubilized from the plasma membrane and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. Using the reconstitution of D-glucose transport as the assay and non-specific L-glucose uptake as control, we have purified a membrane protein fraction from T. brucei bloodstream-form ghosts by EDTA/alkali treatment and solubilization with the detergents octylglucoside or octylthioglucoside. Upon removal of the detergent by dialysis, the solubilized protein fraction was reconstituted in sonicated liposomes by a freeze/thaw-sonication step. The reconstituted transporter catalyzed specific D-glucose uptake and was compared in several characteristics with the native facilitated-diffusion transporter as present in live trypanosomes [Seyfang, A. & Duszenko, M. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 202, 191-196]. As in vivo, the uptake is time dependent and Na+ independent. Transporter substrate affinity and inhibitor specificity are completely retained and it is inhibited by mercuric ions, phloretin and cytochalasin B, but only partially inhibited by phlorizin. The reconstituted transporter also demonstrates trans-stimulation properties indicative of the carrier-mediated transport of D-glucose. In contrast to the human erythrocyte-type glucose transporter, in T. brucei D-fructose uptake was also catalyzed by the same reconstituted protein fraction and specific D-glucose or D-fructose transport were mutually competitive. Both the inhibitor studies and the fructose transport capacity in the reconstituted system are in good agreement with the native transport in live trypanosomes. The specific activity of D-glucose transport was 1.9 +/- 0.3 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1 at 0.2 mM D-glucose and the yield was about 0.8% of total ghost protein after removal of the variant-surface-glycoprotein coat. The successful functional reconstitution of a protozoan glucose transporter represents an important step towards its purification and detailed characterization. This is especially interesting since bloodstream-form trypanosomes depend entirely upon glycolysis for their ATP production."
92,Differential regulation of two distinct families of glucose transporter genes in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1128/mcb.13.2.1146-1154.1993,1993-02-01,[],"A tandemly arranged multigene family encoding putative hexose transporters in Trypanosoma brucei has been characterized. It is composed of two 80% homologous groups of genes called THT1 (six copies) and THT2 (five copies). When Xenopus oocytes are microinjected with in vitro-transcribed RNA from a THT1 gene, they express a glucose transporter with properties similar to those of the trypanosome bloodstream-form protein(s). This THT1-encoded transport system for glucose differs from the human erythrocyte-type glucose transporter by its moderate sensitivity to cytochalasin B and its capacity to transport D-fructose. These properties suggest that the trypanosomal transporter may be a good target for antitrypanosomal drugs. mRNA analysis revealed that expression of these genes was life cycle stage dependent. Bloodstream forms express 40-fold more THT1 than THT2. In contrast, procyclic trypanosomes express no detectable THT1 but demonstrate glucose-dependent expression of THT2."
93,Glucose transport in Crithidia luciliae.,10.1016/0166-6851(92)90149-e,1992-11-01,[],"The glucose analogue, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, was used to characterise the glucose transport system in Crithidia luciliae choanomastigotes. Uptake was temperature dependent with a Q10 of 2, and saturable with a Km of 0.22 mM and Vmax of 5.5 nmol min-1 (mg protein)-1 at 23 degrees C. Preloaded cells showed rapid exchange of intracellular 2-deoxy-D-glucose when incubated with extracellular D-glucose or 2-deoxy-D-glucose but little exchange with L-glucose. The substrate specificity of the uptake was studied using a number of D-glucose analogues. 6-Deoxy-D-glucose, 3-fluoro-3-deoxy-D-glucose and 4-fluoro-4-deoxy-D-glucose all competed for the transporter and had significant inhibitory effects on 2-deoxy-D-glucose transport. In contrast, 1-thio-beta-D-glucose, trehalose, 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, arginine, thymidine, L-sorbose and L-glucose were not inhibitory. The results imply the existence of a glucose transporter. The transport was blocked by a number of inhibitors and ionophores, including fluoride, azide, cyanide, dinitrophenol, valinomycin and nigericin. Overall, the uptake, exchange and efflux of 2-deoxy-D-glucose is consistent with transport via facilitated diffusion."
94,The electrochemical proton gradient in the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei is dependent on the temperature.,10.1016/0166-6851(92)90123-2,1992-10-01,[],"The membrane potential and pH gradient over the plasma membrane of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei were measured with radioactive indicators in combination with the silicone oil centrifugation technique over a range of temperatures. At 37 degrees C a small membrane potential and pH gradient of similar magnitude, but of opposite polarity, were measured. The resulting electrochemical proton gradient was almost zero. However, when the temperature was lowered from 37 degrees C to 22 degrees C, the internal pH was kept constant independent of the external pH and a membrane potential of between -100 and -150 mV was measured, depending on the external pH. Measurements at various temperatures between 15 degrees C and 37 degrees C revealed that above 26 degrees C the membrane potential collapsed and that this collapse correlated with a sudden increase in membrane fluidity. The uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and of pyruvate, which are both mediated by facilitated diffusion carriers in the plasma membrane of the trypanosome, were also affected by this sudden increase in fluidity of the membrane. The overall rate of the conversion of glucose into its metabolites, which is independent of the plasma membrane, varied only gradually. We conclude (i) that major changes occur in the plasma membrane of T. brucei around 26 degrees C, that affect all membrane related processes; (ii) that the electrochemical proton gradient plays a minor role in the energy metabolism of T. brucei when it resides in the bloodstream of the mammalian host at 37 degrees C; and (iii) that below 26 degrees C an electrochemical proton gradient is maintained over the plasma membrane."
95,A potential hexose transporter gene expressed predominantly in the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(92)90040-q,1992-05-01,[],"A cDNA cloned from Trypanosoma brucei brucei codes for a putative membrane protein which is homologous to the erythrocyte glucose transporter and several other sugar transporters from Escherichia coli, yeast, algae and Leishmania. This cDNA hybridizes to a 2.3-kb mRNA that accumulates to a much higher degree in the bloodstream mammalian form than in the procyclic insect form of the parasite. The correlation between the expression of this gene and the hexose metabolism of Leishmania enriettii and T. brucei suggest that these 2 related genes probably encode hexose transporters. The gene encoding this mRNA is a member of a multigene family. The putative hexose transporter gene is highly conserved among Kinetoplastidae, indicating an important role for this protein in the parasite life cycle."
96,Mutual adjustment of glucose uptake and metabolism in Trypanosoma brucei grown in a chemostat.,10.1128/jb.174.4.1273-1279.1992,1992-02-01,[],"The mutual adjustment of glucose uptake and metabolism in the insect stage of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei was studied. T. brucei was preadapted in the chemostat to conditions in which either glucose or proline served as the major carbon and energy source. Cells were grown and adapted to either energy or non-energy limitation at a low dilution rate (0.5 day-1) or a high dilution rate (1 day-1). The cells were then used in short- to medium-term uptake experiments with D-[14C]glucose as a tracer. In time course experiments a steady state was reached after 15 min regardless of the preadaptation conditions. This steady-state level increased with increasing glucose availability during preadaptation. The rate of glucose uptake and the hexokinase activity were linearly correlated. In short-term 5- to 90-s) uptake experiments a high transport rate was measured with cultures grown in excess glucose, an intermediate rate was measured with proline-grown cultures, and a low rate was measured in organisms grown under glucose limitation. Glucose metabolism and proline metabolism did not affect each other during the 15-min incubations. Glucose uptake, as a function of the external glucose concentration, did not obey simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics but could be described by a two-step mechanism: (i) transport of glucose by facilitated diffusion and (ii) subsequent metabolism of glucose. The respective rates of the two steps were adjusted to each other. It is concluded that T. brucei is capable of adjusting the different metabolic processes in a way that gives maximum energy efficiency at the cost of short-term flexibility."
97,Specificity of glucose transport in Trypanosoma brucei. Effective inhibition by phloretin and cytochalasin B.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb16362.x,1991-11-15,[],"Glucose transport in the bloodstream form of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei was characterized by enzymatically measuring the D-glucose uptake. Uptake kinetics showed a concentration-dependent saturable process, typical for a carrier-mediated transport system, with an apparent Km = 0.49 +/- 0.14 mM and Vmax = 252 +/- 43 nmol.min-1.mg cell protein-1 (equal to 2.25 x 10(8) trypanosomes). The specificity of glucose transport was investigated by inhibitor studies. Glucose uptake was shown to be sodium independent; neither the Na+/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor ouabain (1 mM) nor the ionophor monensin (1 microM) inhibited uptake. Transport was also unaffected by the H(+)-ATPase inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD; 20 microM) and the uncoupler carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP; 1 microM). However, highly significant inhibition was obtained with both phloretin (82% at 0.13 mM; Ki = 64 microM) and cytochalasin B (77% at 0.3 mM; Ki = 0.44 mM), and partial inhibition with phlorizin (14% at 0.5 mM; Ki = 3.0 mM). In each case, inhibition was noncompetitive, partially reversible (45%) for phloretin and completely reversible for cytochalasin B and phlorizin. Measurement of the temperature-dependent glucose uptake between 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C resulted in a temperature quotient of Q10 = 1.97 +/- 0.02 and an activation energy of Ea = 52.12 +/- 1.00 kJ/mol for glucose uptake. We conclude that glucose uptake in T. brucei bloodstream forms occurs via a facilitated diffusion system, clearly distinguished from the human erythrocyte-type glucose transporter with about a 10-fold higher affinity for glucose and about a 1000-fold decreased sensitivity to the inhibitor cytochalasin B."
98,Differences in glucose transport between blood stream and procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.,10.1016/0166-6851(91)90149-z,1991-07-01,[],"In African trypanosomes the requirements for glucose and its metabolism vary in different stages of the life cycle. Here we present evidence that cultured procyclic trypanosomes of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense uptake glucose against a concentration gradient in a time and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, glucose transport is completely inhibited by the sulphydryl inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide, suggesting the presence of a protein moiety as the carrier molecule. Comparison of glucose uptake in bloodstream and procyclic trypanosomes point to the possibility that different transporters may function in the 2 developmental stages. Glucose uptake by bloodstream trypanosomes requires Na+ ions and is inhibited by phlorizin, an inhibitor of Na(+)-dependent glucose transporters in mammalian cells. Conversely, procyclic trypanosomes transport glucose in a Na(+)-dependent manner, and transport is not affected by phlorizin. Finally, the putative procyclic glucose transporter has a higher affinity for glucose (apparent Km 23 microM) than the bloodstream carrier (apparent Km 237 microM)."
100,Active transport of 2-deoxy-D-glucose in Trypanosoma brucei procyclic forms.,10.1016/0166-6851(90)90162-f,1990-09-01,[],"The characteristics of glucose transport by procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei were examined in a rapid transport assay using the glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose. In contrast to bloodforms where the Km for 2-deoxyglucose transport is about 1 mM, procyclic forms have a Km of about 38 microM. Procyclic forms show temperature-dependent, saturable import, and import of 2-deoxyglucose is competitive with glucose and mannose. Unlike the bloodforms which employ facilitated diffusion, the procyclic forms actively transport glucose. Use of inhibitors and ionophores suggests that a protonmotive force is required for glucose transport in procyclic forms. Unlike the human erythrocyte glucose transporter, the glucose transporter of the T. brucei procyclic form is relatively insensitive to inhibition by cytocholasin B."
101,Specificity and kinetics of hexose transport in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0005-2736(89)90107-7,1989-10-02,[],"Transport of 6-deoxy-D-glucose was studied in Trypanosoma brucei in order to characterise the kinetics of hexose transport in this organism using a nonphosphorylated sugar. Kinetic parameters for efflux and entry, measured using zero-trans and equilibrium exchange protocols, indicate that the transporter is probably kinetically symmetrical. Comparison of the kinetic constants of D-glucose metabolism with those for 6-deoxy-D-glucose transport shows that transport across the plasma membrane is likely to be the rate-limiting step of glucose utilisation. The transport rate is nevertheless very fast and 6-deoxy-D-glucose, at concentrations below Km, enters the cells with a half filling time of less than 2 s at 20 degrees C. Thus the high metabolic capacity of these organisms is matched by a high transport rate. The structural requirements for the trypanosome hexose transporter were explored by measuring inhibition constants (Ki) for a range of D-glucose analogues including fluoro and deoxy sugars as well as epimeric hexoses. The relative affinities shown by these analogues indicated H-bonds from the carrier to the C-3, C-4 and C-5 hydroxyl oxygens and from the C-1 and C-3 hydroxyl hydrogens to the binding site. Hydrophobic interactions are likely at the C-2 and C-6 regions of the glucose molecule. Spatial constraints appear to occur around C-4 indicating that the transport site at this position is not freely open to the external solution as is the case with the mammalian hexose transporter. However, the trypanosome transporter appears to accept D-fructose but the common mammalian (erythrocyte type) hexose transporter does not."

The production of pyruvate, glycerol and glycerol-3-phosphate by intact and digitonin-permeabilized Trypanosoma brucei brucei has been studied with glucose or the glycolytic intermediates as substrates. 2. Under aerobic conditions hexosephosphates gave maximal glycolysis in the presence of 40-60 micrograms digitonin/10(8) trypanosomes while the triosephosphates gave it at 20-30 micrograms digitonin/10(8) trypanosomes. 3. In the presence of salicylhydroxamic acid, and the glycolytic intermediates, permeabilized trypanosomes produced equimolar amounts of pyruvate and glycerol-3-phosphate and no glycerol. Under the same conditions, glucose catabolism produced glycerol in addition to pyruvated and glycerol-3-phosphate. 4. In the presence of salicylhydroxamic acid and ATP or ADP intact trypanosomes produced equimolar amounts of pyruvate and (glycerol plus glycerol-3-phosphate) with glucose as substrate. 5. A carrier for ATP and ADP at the glycosomal membrane is implicated. 6.

D-Glucose oxidation is competitively inhibited by 1-deoxy-D-glucose. However, we show that 1-deoxy-D-glucose is not a substrate for metabolism and that the competition occurs because of interaction at the transport system. D-Glucose competitively inhibits 1-deoxy-D-glucose influx."
104,Comparison of glycolysis in intact and digitonin-permeabilized bloodstream trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0020-711x(83)90030-7,1983-01-01,[],"Digitonin has been used to permeabilize bloodstream trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma brucei. Such permeabilized parasites revealed a fully-functional glycolytic pathway which catabolized glucose and some phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates. Glucose-starved bloodstream trypomastigotes revealed saturation kinetics with a glucose Km = 0.6 mM and Vmax = 150 natom O/min per 10(8) for intact parasites; Km = 4 mM and Vmax = 100 natom O2/min per 10(8) for permeabilized parasites. Glucose oxidation in intact parasites was stimulated 40% by addition of 3 micrograms digitonin/10(8) parasites. Higher concentrations of digitonin than this inhibited the glucose oxidation. Ten millimolar phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) inhibited the rate of O2 consumption by permeabilized trypanosomes respiring on glucose under aerobic conditions by 50%. It is proposed that glucose oxidation is apparently limited by transport across trypanosomal plasma membrane, and phosphofructokinase is regulated by PEP levels. It is concluded that permeabilization of trypanosomes with digitonin might offer a closer physiological condition for the study of the regulation of glycolysis by using glycolytic intermediates and other chemical compounds which would otherwise not be transported across the membrane(s)."
105,Role of glycerol permeation in the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1111/j.1550-7408.1980.tb05404.x,1980-11-01,[],"Under aerobic conditions, we have determined glycerol uptake in the long slender (LS) bloodstream form of Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) brucei brucei by studying glycerophosphate accumulation in the parasites. The coupled enzyme theory applies to the permeation-phosphorylation sequence. Glycerol passage through the plasma membrane is asymmetric, the efflux process being favored over the influx process. No free diffusion of glycerol can be detected even under conditions under which free glycerol accumulates within the cells; most probably, glycerol permeation is mediated by a specific transport system. In the absence of respiratory activities, glycerol is known to be an end-product of T. brucei glycolysis; its production from glycerophosphate should allow ATP synthesis. The observed efflux of free glycerol following intracellular accumulation of glycerophosphate confirms the hypothesis that glycerol production occurs through reversal of glycerol kinase activity. We conclude that in vivo the role of the carrier-mediated asymmetric permeation process is to prevent inhibition of the reversal of the glycerol kinase-mediated reaction by removing free glycerol."
107,Effects of oligomycin on glucose utilization and calcium transport in African trypanosomes.,10.1099/00221287-116-2-391,1980-02-01,[],"Oligomycin (3 microgram ml-1) inhibited glucose utilization in Trypanosoma brucei S42 as shown by measurements of oxygen uptake and pyruvate production. Carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone, an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, did not relieve this inhibition, although some relief was afforded by the alternative substrate glycerol. Naturally dyskinetoplastic Trypanosoma evansi MIAG 105 was less sensitive to inhibition by oligomycin although glycerol relief was still observed, relecting the differential sensitivity of the two pathways. With glucose present as the substrate, 45Ca2+ transport was inhibited by oligomycin in T. brucei, but was stimulated in T. evansi. These results are discussed in terms of alternative systems for maintaining cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations in normal and dyskinetoplastic strains of trypanosome."

D-Glucose transport is the rate-limiting step of its metabolism.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1978.tb12549.x,1978-09-01,[],"D-Glucose and 2-deoxyglucose enter the 'long-slender' bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei only by means of a carrier-mediated process; no free diffusion can be observed. Permeation is not energy-dependent. The uptake is driven by the downhill concentration gradient of free substrate. The latter is maintained by the continual removal of sugar, due to the extremely high activities of the glycolytic enzymes. The permeation process is the rate-limiting step of glucose consumption, because permeation proceeds at a rate slower than metabolism. The inhibition of sugar uptake by glycerol was tested. Interactions at the carrier site can be ruled out since glucose and its 2-deoxy analog exhibit different inhibition kinetics."

As a consequence, bacteria and yeasts have developed regulatory mechanisms involving nutrient sensing and signaling, known as ""catabolite repression,"" allowing redirection of cell metabolism to maximize the consumption of an energy-efficient carbon source. Here, we report a new mechanism named ""metabolic contest"" for regulating the use of carbon sources without nutrient sensing and signaling. Trypanosoma brucei is a unicellular eukaryote transmitted by tsetse flies and causing human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness. We showed that, in contrast to most microorganisms, the insect stages of this parasite developed a preference for glycerol over glucose, with glucose consumption beginning after the depletion of glycerol present in the medium. This ""metabolic contest"" depends on the combination of 3 conditions: (i) the sequestration of both metabolic pathways in the same subcellular compartment, here in the peroxisomal-related organelles named glycosomes; (ii) the competition for the same substrate, here ATP, with the first enzymatic step of the glycerol and glucose metabolic pathways both being ATP-dependent (glycerol kinase and hexokinase, respectively); and (iii) an unbalanced activity between the competing enzymes, here the glycerol kinase activity being approximately 80-fold higher than the hexokinase activity. As predicted by our model, an approximately 50-fold down-regulation of the GK expression abolished the preference for glycerol over glucose, with glucose and glycerol being metabolized concomitantly. In theory, a metabolic contest could be found in any organism provided that the 3 conditions listed above are met."

Proline is essential for the midgut colonization of the parasite in the insect vector, however other carbon sources could be available and used to feed its central metabolism. Here we show that procyclic trypanosomes can consume and metabolize metabolic intermediates, including those excreted from glucose catabolism (succinate, alanine and pyruvate), with the exception of acetate, which is the ultimate end-product excreted by the parasite. Among the tested metabolites, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates (succinate, malate and α-ketoglutarate) stimulated growth of the parasite in the presence of 2 mM proline. The pathways used for their metabolism were mapped by proton-NMR metabolic profiling and phenotypic analyses of thirteen RNAi and/or null mutants affecting central carbon metabolism. We showed that (i) malate is converted to succinate by both the reducing and oxidative branches of the TCA cycle, which demonstrates that procyclic trypanosomes can use the full TCA cycle, (ii) the enormous rate of α-ketoglutarate consumption (15-times higher than glucose) is possible thanks to the balanced production and consumption of NADH at the substrate level and (iii) α-ketoglutarate is toxic for trypanosomes if not appropriately metabolized as observed for an α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase null mutant. In addition, epimastigotes produced from procyclics upon overexpression of RBP6 showed a growth defect in the presence of 2 mM proline, which is rescued by α-ketoglutarate, suggesting that physiological amounts of proline are not sufficient per se for the development of trypanosomes in the fly. In conclusion, these data show that trypanosomes can metabolize multiple metabolites, in addition to proline, which allows them to confront challenging environments in the fly."

They are generally found in developing countries, where lack of access to preventive tools and treatment hinders their management. Because these parasites share an increased demand on glucose consumption with most cancer cells, six compounds used in anti-tumoral research were selected to be tested as antiparasitic agents in in vitro models of Leishmania infantum, Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, and Plasmodium falciparum: dichloroacetic acid (DCA), 3-bromopyruvic acid (3BP), 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), lonidamine (LND), metformin (MET), and sirolimus (SIR). No parasite-killing activity was found in L. infantum promastigotes, whereas DCA and 3BP reduced the burden of intra-macrophagic amastigotes. For T. brucei all selected compounds, but 2DG, decreased parasite survival. DCA, 2DG, LND and MET showed parasite-killing activity in T. cruzi. Finally, anti-plasmodial activity was found for DCA, 2DG, LND, MET and SIR. These results reinforce the hypothesis that drugs with proven efficacy in the treatment of cancer by interfering with ATP production, proliferation, and survival cell strategies might be useful in treating threatening parasitic diseases and provide new opportunities for their repurposing."

The skin and adipose tissues were recently identified as additional major sites for parasite development. Glucose was the only carbon source known to be used by bloodstream trypanosomes to feed their central carbon metabolism, however, the metabolic behaviour of extravascular tissue-adapted parasites has not been addressed yet. Since the production of glycerol is an important primary function of adipocytes, we have adapted BSF trypanosomes to a glucose-depleted but glycerol-rich culture medium (CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc) and compared their metabolism and proteome to those of parasites grown in standard glucose-rich conditions (CMM_Glc). BSF were shown to consume 2-folds more oxygen per consumed carbon unit in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc and were 11.5-times more sensitive to SHAM, a specific inhibitor of the plant-like alternative oxidase (TAO), which is the only mitochondrial terminal oxidase expressed in BSF. This is consistent with (i) the absolute requirement of the mitochondrial respiratory activity to convert glycerol into dihydroxyacetone phosphate, as deduced from the updated metabolic scheme and (ii) with the 1.8-fold increase of the TAO expression level compared to the presence of glucose. Proton NMR analysis of excreted end products from glycerol and glucose metabolism showed that these two carbon sources are metabolised through the same pathways, although the contributions of the acetate and succinate branches are more important in the presence of glycerol than glucose (10.2% versus 3.4% of the excreted end products, respectively). In addition, metabolomic analyses by mass spectrometry showed that, in the absence of glucose, 13C-labelled glycerol was incorporated into hexose phosphates through gluconeogenesis. As expected, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of glycerol kinase expression abolished glycerol metabolism and was lethal for BSF grown in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc. Interestingly, BSF have adapted their metabolism to grow in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc by concomitantly increasing their rate of glycerol consumption and decreasing that of glucose. However, the glycerol kinase activity was 7.8-fold lower in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc, as confirmed by both western blotting and proteomic analyses. This suggests that the huge excess in glycerol kinase that is not absolutely required for glycerol metabolism, might be used for another yet undetermined non-essential function in glucose rich-conditions. Altogether, these data demonstrate that BSF trypanosomes are well-adapted to glycerol-rich conditions that could be encountered by the parasite in extravascular niches, such as the skin and adipose tissues."

This methodology enables detection of putative metabolites from biological samples and simultaneous quantification of the pattern and extent of isotope labeling. Labeling of Trypanosoma brucei cell cultures with 50% uniformly (13)C-labeled glucose demonstrated incorporation of glucose-derived carbon into 187 of 588 putatively identified metabolites in diverse pathways including carbohydrate, nucleotide, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. Labeling patterns confirmed the metabolic pathways responsible for the biosynthesis of many detected metabolites, and labeling was detected in unexpected metabolites, including two higher sugar phosphates annotated as octulose phosphate and nonulose phosphate. This untargeted approach to stable isotope tracing facilitates the biochemical analysis of known pathways and yields rapid identification of previously unexplored areas of metabolism."
121,Proliferating bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei use a negligible part of consumed glucose for anabolic processes.,10.1016/j.ijpara.2012.04.009,2012-05-15,[],"Our quantitative knowledge of carbon fluxes in the long slender bloodstream form (BSF) Trypanosoma brucei is mainly based on non-proliferating parasites, isolated from laboratory animals and kept in buffers. In this paper we present a carbon balance for exponentially growing bloodstream form trypanosomes. The cells grew with a doubling time of 5.3h, contained 46 μ mol of carbon (10(8) cells)(-1) and had a glucose consumption flux of 160 nmol min(-1) (10(8) cells)(-1). The molar ratio of pyruvate excreted versus glucose consumed was 2.1. Furthermore, analysis of the (13)C label distribution in pyruvate in (13)C-glucose incubations of exponentially growing trypanosomes showed that glucose was the sole substrate for pyruvate production. We conclude that the glucose metabolised in glycolysis was hardly, if at all, used for biosynthetic processes. Carbon flux through glycolysis in exponentially growing trypanosomes was 10 times higher than the incorporation of carbon into biomass. This biosynthetic carbon is derived from other precursors present in the nutrient rich growth medium. Furthermore, we found that the glycolytic flux was unaltered when the culture went into stationary phase, suggesting that most of the ATP produced in glycolysis is used for processes other than growth."
122,Ablation of succinate production from glucose metabolism in the procyclic trypanosomes induces metabolic switches to the glycerol 3-phosphate/dihydroxyacetone phosphate shuttle and to proline metabolism.,10.1074/jbc.M110.124917,2010-08-13,[],"Trypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protist that undergoes a complex life cycle during transmission from its mammalian host (bloodstream forms) to the midgut of its insect vector (procyclic form). In both parasitic forms, most glycolytic steps take place within specialized peroxisomes, called glycosomes. Here, we studied metabolic adaptations in procyclic trypanosome mutants affected in their maintenance of the glycosomal redox balance. T. brucei can theoretically use three strategies to maintain the glycosomal NAD(+)/NADH balance as follows: (i) the glycosomal succinic fermentation branch; (ii) the glycerol 3-phosphate (Gly-3-P)/dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) shuttle that transfers reducing equivalents to the mitochondrion; and (iii) the glycosomal glycerol production pathway. We showed a hierarchy in the use of these glycosomal NADH-consuming pathways by determining metabolic perturbations and adaptations in single and double mutant cell lines using a combination of NMR, ion chromatography-MS/MS, and HPLC approaches. Although functional, the Gly-3-P/DHAP shuttle is primarily used when the preferred succinate fermentation pathway is abolished in the Δpepck knock-out mutant cell line. In the absence of these two pathways (Δpepck/(RNAi)FAD-GPDH.i mutant), glycerol production is used but with a 16-fold reduced glycolytic flux. In addition, the Δpepck mutant cell line shows a 3.3-fold reduced glycolytic flux compensated by an increase of proline metabolism. The inability of the Δpepck mutant to maintain a high glycolytic flux demonstrates that the Gly-3-P/DHAP shuttle is not adapted to the procyclic trypanosome context. In contrast, this shuttle was shown earlier to be the only way used by the bloodstream forms of T. brucei to sustain their high glycolytic flux."

Here we present an experimental, quantitative assessment of the importance of these enzymes for the glycolytic pathway. This was achieved by decreasing the concentrations of ALD and GAPDH by RNA interference. The effects of these knockdowns on parasite growth, levels of various enzymes and transcripts, enzyme activities and glucose consumption were studied. A partial depletion of ALD and GAPDH was already sufficient to rapidly kill the trypanosomes. An effect was also observed on the activity of some other glycolytic enzymes."
124,A mitochondrial NADH-dependent fumarate reductase involved in the production of succinate excreted by procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.M500343200,2005-02-19,[],"Trypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protist responsible for sleeping sickness in humans. The procyclic stage of T. brucei expresses a soluble NADH-dependent fumarate reductase (FRDg) in the peroxisome-like organelles called glycosomes. This enzyme is responsible for the production of about 70% of the excreted succinate, the major end product of glucose metabolism in this form of the parasite. Here we functionally characterize a new gene encoding FRD (FRDm1) expressed in the procyclic stage. FRDm1 is a mitochondrial protein, as evidenced by immunolocalization, fractionation of digitonin-permeabilized cells, and expression of EGFP-tagged FRDm1 in the parasite. RNA interference was used to deplete FRDm1, FRDg, or both together. The analysis of the resulting mutant cell lines showed that FRDm1 is responsible for 30% of the cellular NADH-FRD activity, which solves a long standing debate regarding the existence of a mitochondrial FRD in trypanosomatids. FRDg and FRDm1 together account for the total NADH-FRD activity in procyclics, because no activity was measured in the double mutant lacking expression of both proteins. Analysis of the end products of 13C-enriched glucose excreted by these mutant cell lines showed that FRDm1 contributes to the production of between 14 and 44% of the succinate excreted by the wild type cells. In addition, depletion of one or both FRD enzymes results in up to 2-fold reduction of the rate of glucose consumption. We propose that FRDm1 is involved in the maintenance of the redox balance in the mitochondrion, as proposed for the ancestral soluble FRD presumably present in primitive anaerobic cells."
125,Acetyl:succinate CoA-transferase in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei. Gene identification and role in carbohydrate metabolism.,10.1074/jbc.M407513200,2004-08-25,[],"Acetyl:succinate CoA-transferase (ASCT) is an acetate-producing enzyme shared by hydrogenosomes, mitochondria of trypanosomatids, and anaerobically functioning mitochondria. The gene encoding ASCT in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei was identified as a new member of the CoA transferase family. Its assignment to ASCT activity was confirmed by 1) a quantitative correlation of protein expression and activity upon RNA interference-mediated repression, 2) the absence of activity in homozygous Deltaasct/Deltaasct knock out cells, 3) mitochondrial colocalization of protein and activity, 4) increased activity and acetate excretion upon transgenic overexpression, and 5) depletion of ASCT activity from lysates upon immunoprecipitation. Genetic ablation of ASCT produced a severe growth phenotype, increased glucose consumption, and excretion of beta-hydroxybutyrate and pyruvate, indicating accumulation of acetyl-CoA. Analysis of the excreted end products of (13)C-enriched and (14)C-labeled glucose metabolism showed that acetate excretion was only slightly reduced. Adaptation to ASCT deficiency, however, was an infrequent event at the population level, indicating the importance of this enzyme. These studies show that ASCT is indeed involved in acetate production, but is not essential, as apparently it is not the only enzyme that produces acetate in T. brucei."
126,Roles of triosephosphate isomerase and aerobic metabolism in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1042/0264-6021:3570117,2001-06-21,[],"Kinetoplastid protozoa compartmentalize the first seven enzymes of glycolysis and two enzymes of glycerol metabolism in a microbody, the glycosome. While in its mammalian host, Trypanosoma brucei depends entirely on glucose for ATP generation. Under aerobic conditions, most of the glucose is metabolized to pyruvate. Aerobic metabolism depends on the activities of glycosomal triosephosphate isomerase and a mitochondrial glycerophosphate oxidase, and on glycerophosphate<-->dihydroxyacetone phosphate exchange across the glycosomal membrane. Using a combination of genetics and computer modelling, we show that triosephosphate isomerase is probably essential for bloodstream trypanosome survival, but not for the insect-dwelling procyclics, which preferentially use amino acids as an energy source. When the enzyme level decreased to about 15% of that of the wild-type, the growth rate was halved. Below this level, a lethal rise in dihydroxyacetone phosphate was predicted. Expression of cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase inhibited cell growth. Attempts to knockout the trypanosome alternative oxidase genes (which are needed for glycerophosphate oxidase activity) were unsuccessful, but when we lowered the level of the corresponding mRNA by expressing a homologous double-stranded RNA, oxygen consumption was reduced fourfold and the rate of trypanosome growth was halved."
127,Adaptation of metabolic enzyme activities of Trypanosoma brucei promastigotes to growth rate and carbon regimen.,10.1128/jb.179.15.4699-4705.1997,1997-08-01,[],"The insect stage of Trypanosoma brucei adapted the activities of 16 metabolic enzymes to growth rate and carbon source. Cells were grown in chemostats with glucose, rate limiting or in excess, or high concentrations of proline as carbon and energy sources. At each steady state, samples were collected for measurements of substrate and end product concentrations, cellular parameters, and enzyme activities. Correlation coefficients were calculated for all parameters and used to analyze the data set. Rates of substrate consumption and end product formation increased with increasing growth rate. Acetate and succinate were the major nonvolatile end products, but measurable quantities of alanine were also produced. More acetate than succinate was formed during growth on glucose, but growth on proline yielded an equimolar ratio. Growth rate barely affected the relative amounts of end products formed. The end products accounted for the glucose consumed during glucose-limited growth and growth at high rates on excess glucose. A discrepancy, indicating production of CO2, occurred during slow growth on excess glucose and, even more pronounced, in cells growing on proline. The activities of the metabolic enzymes varied by factors of 2 to 40. There was no single enzyme that correlated with consumption of substrate and/or end product formation in all cases. A group of enzymes whose activities rigorously covaried could also not be identified. These findings indicate that T. brucei adapted the activities of each of the metabolic enzymes studied separately. The results of this complex manner of adaptation were more or less constant ratios of the end products and a very efficient energy metabolism."
132,Non-cytochrome mediated mitochondrial ATP production in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18118.x,1993-08-15,[],"The life cycle of Trypanosoma brucei brucei involves a series of differentiation steps characterized by marked changes in mitochondrial development and function. The bloodstream forms of this parasite completely lack cytochromes and have not been considered to have any Krebs cycle function. It has been suggested that glycolysis is the sole source of ATP in all bloodstream forms. However, earlier results indicated that in the mitochondria of the transitional intermediate/short stumpy bloodstream forms, the biochemical pathways are present that could allow intra-mitochondrial production of ATP. Using a high mannitol buffer to enhance permeability, we confirm previous observations showing that transitional forms maintain motility and respiratory activity with 2-oxoglutarate as the sole substrate. Using a luminometer to measure intracellular ATP levels via the luciferin/luciferase chemiluminescence assay, we show that these same transitional forms, but not long slender forms, maintain high levels of intracellular ATP in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate. Further, in the presence of bongkrekic acid, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase, ATP levels are reduced with subsequent death and lysis of the cells when 2-oxoglutarate, but not glucose, is used as sole substrate. These data are direct evidence of ATP production by transitional bloodstream form mitochondria."
133,Aerobic fermentation of glucose by trypanosomatids.,10.1096/fasebj.6.13.1397837,1992-10-01,[],"The consumption of glucose by trypanosomatid protozoa such as Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania spp., and Crithidia spp. is characterized by the excretion of reduced products such as succinate, pyruvate, ethanol, L-alanine, or lactate (depending on the species) not only in anaerobiosis, but also under aerobic conditions. The ""aerobic fermentation"" of glucose is accompanied by a complete lack, or even a reversal, of the Pasteur effect. This peculiar catabolism is mediated by a so-far unique compartmentation of the glycolytic enzymes, most of which are placed in an organelle called the glycosome; by an almost complete lack of inhibitory controls at the level of hexokinase and phosphofructokinase; and by a central role of CO2 fixation through the reaction catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. The production of fermentative products seems to be due to a relative inefficiency of the respiratory chain, which lacks NADH dehydrogenase and the first phosphorylation site and preferentially uses succinate as substrate."
134,Differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream trypomastigotes from long slender to short stumpy-like forms in axenic culture.,10.1016/0166-6851(90)90075-w,1990-04-01,[],"An axenic cultivation system was used to study the differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms from long slender to short stumpy-like forms. Trypanosomes in the logarithmic phase are similar to long slender bloodstream forms freshly isolated from infected mice, differing only in the rate of oxygen uptake. In contrast, trypanosomes in the stationary phase show a decreased level of glucose oxidation, express pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (proline oxidase), are inhibited in oxygen uptake to about 44% by KCN, undergo considerable morphological changes on the cellular and subcellular level, and have a significantly smaller cell volume. These results are comparable to those observed during the differentiation of long slender to short stumpy forms in infected animals, suggesting that the differentiation process towards insect procyclic forms can be initiated in culture at 37 degrees C. As judged from immunofluorescence and electron microscopy analysis, the surface coat remains intact."
135,Hydrogen peroxide metabolism in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(86)90023-x,1986-08-01,[],"Contrary to previous reports in the literature, bloodstream forms of the haemoflagellate protozoan Trypanosoma brucei brucei are not deficient in their ability to metabolize hydrogen peroxide, although they either lack or only possess the normal enzymes for H2O2 detoxification, catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) and glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9), at extremely low levels. The hydrogen peroxide which is consumed appears to be reduced by NADPH derived from glucose via the pentose phosphate pathway. This process requires the newly discovered cofactor trypanothione."

(T.) b. rhodesiense, and T. (T.) b. gambiense was developed. The standard system consists of a feeder layer of fibroblast-like cells derived from embryos of New Zealand White rabbits (REF( or a mountain vole, Microtus montanus (MEF), with HEPES-buffered Minimum Essential Medium (MEM), with Earle's salts, supplemented with 15% inactivated rabbit serum. These two and other feeder layers were cross-checked with different sera to test for growth support of bloodstream forms of the three trypanosome subspecies studied. Cultures could be initiated with bloodstream forms from mammalian hosts or from cryopreserved stabilates. Metacyclic forms from infected Glossina m. morsitans could also be sued as inoculum; they transformed within 6 h to bloodstream forms. Maintenance of cultures and growth properties are described in detail. Experiments were undertaken to confirm that the cultivated bloodstream forms still possess some fo the characteristic features of pleomorphic bloodstream populations. Cultivated bloodstream forms were always infective for mice, and a surface coat could be demonstrated by electron microscopy. They could also be cyclically transmitted through tsetse flies, and the metacyclic forms from these flies could be brought back into culture. In vitro cloning with single bloodstream forms and metacyclic forms could be achieve with high cloning efficiency. The consumption of glucose and the production of pyruvate and lactate were determined."
141,Uptake of the trypanocidal drug suramin by bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei and its effect on respiration and growth rate in vivo.,10.1016/0166-6851(80)90050-x,1980-10-01,[],"After a single intravenous injection of suramin the rate of removal of the drug from the plasma into other tissue compartments of the rat is independent of initial concentration. The data can be fitted to the sum of two exponential functions, consistent with a two-compartment, open model system. Trypanosomes take up only small amounts of suramin in vivo and do not actively concentrate the drug within the cell. Uptake is apparently by a non-saturable process that decreases with time and is dependent on the amount of suramin already taken up. Once within the cell, suramin progressively inhibits respiration and glycolysis, such that, for a given exposure in vivo, inhibition of oxygen consumption is proportional to the total amount of suramin absorbed. It can be calculated that only a fraction (4--9%) of this total is required to inhibit respiration to the extent found in broken cell preparations. The combined inhibition of two key enzymes in glycolysis--the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase (EC unassigned) and the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) (sn-glycerol-3-phosphate: NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.8)--are sufficient to account for the differential inhibition of glucose and oxygen consumption and of pyruvate production, together with the small, but significant, production of glycerol. Even at the highest dose of suramin tolerated by the rat, trypanosomes continue to increase exponentially in the bloodstream for at least 6 h. The mean doubling time is increased from 4.6 h to a maximum of about 12.5 h in rats treated with doses of suramin in the range 25--150 mg/kg. In the light of these and other findings, it is concluded that part of the trypanocidal action of suramin results from the inhibition of ATP production by glycolysis."
142,Trypanosoma brucei brucei: patterns of glycolysis at 37 degrees C in vitro.,10.1016/0166-6851(80)90062-6,1980-09-01,[],"In the absence of mammalian cells, freshly isolated monomorphic bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei maintain a constant and high level of aerobic glycolysis in vitro for at least 4 h at 37 degrees C when suspended in RPMI medium 1640 containing 20% heat-inactivated and dialyzed fetal calf serum and 25 mM Hepes at an initial pH of 8. In the absence of nutrients other than glucose, salts and protein, some cell death and a decrease in the rate of glycolysis are observed. In the absence of protein, extensive cell death and a decrease in the rate of glycolysis are seen. These observations may be useful in the design of short-term in vitro metabolic studies with T. b. brucei."

The present study therefore assessed the course of untreated Trypanosoma brucei brucei infection on hepatic glycogen, hepatic hexokinase and glucokinase activities.
Mice were grouped into two: control and infected group. Trypanosomiasis was induced by intraperitoneal inoculation of 1 × 10
The infection resulted in decrease in blood glucose, hepatic glycogen, liver protein, PCV, hepatic hexokinase and glucokinase activities, but increase in serum total protein and liver biomarkers.
Trypanosomiasis negatively affects hepatic integrity, resulting in the depletion of hepatic glycogen content and suppression of both hepatic hexokinase and glucokinase activities. The suppression of hepatic hexokinase and glucokinase activities suggested that trypanosomiasis affected the oxidation of glucose and host energy generation via glycolysis. This probably denied the host of the needed energy which is likely the reason for early death in untreated African trypanosomiasis."

Mammals and bloodstream form (BSF) Trypanosoma brucei obtain iron by receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin bound to receptors (TfR) but the mechanisms by which T. brucei subsequently handles iron remains enigmatic. Here, we analyse the transcriptome of T. brucei cultured in iron-rich and iron-poor conditions. We show that adaptation to iron-deprivation induces upregulation of TfR, a cohort of parasite-specific genes (ESAG3, PAGS), genes involved in glucose uptake and glycolysis (THT1 and hexokinase), endocytosis (Phosphatidic Acid Phosphatase, PAP2), and most notably a divergent RNA binding protein RBP5, indicative of a non-canonical mechanism for regulating intracellular iron levels. We show that cells depleted of TfR by RNA silencing import free iron as a compensatory survival strategy. The TfR and RBP5 iron response are reversible by genetic complementation, the response kinetics are similar, but the regulatory mechanisms are distinct. Increased TfR protein is due to increased mRNA. Increased RBP5 expression, however, occurs by a post-transcriptional feedback mechanism whereby RBP5 interacts with its own, and with PAP2 mRNAs. Further observations suggest that increased RBP5 expression in iron-deprived cells has a maximum threshold as ectopic overexpression above this threshold disrupts normal cell cycle progression resulting in an accumulation of anucleate cells and cells in G2/M phase. This phenotype is not observed with overexpression of RPB5 containing a point mutation (F61A) in its single RNA Recognition Motif. Our experiments shed new light on how T. brucei BSFs reorganise their transcriptome to deal with iron stress revealing the first iron responsive RNA binding protein that is co-regulated with TfR, is important for cell viability and iron homeostasis; two essential processes for successful proliferation."

It enters animal cells like a lactate: via monocarboxylic acid transporters. Increasing interest in this compound, in recent times, is mainly due to hopes associated with its anticancer action. It is based on the impairment of energy metabolism of tumor cells by inhibiting enzymes in the glycolysis pathway (hexokinase II, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase) and the oxidative phosphorylation (succinate dehydrogenase). Two cases of clinical application of this compound in the treatment of advanced cancers were reported. By using 3-BrPA, rheumatoid arthritis in SKG mice has been reduced. This compound has also antiparasitic activity: lowers cell viability of Trypanosoma brucei, decreases intracellular proliferation of Toxoplasma gondii and reduces the metabolic activity of Schistosoma mansoni. It also has antifungal properties; particularly it acts strongly on Cryptococcus neoformans, as well as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An inhibitory effect on bacterial enzymes was also described on: isocitrate lyase from Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas indigofera and 2-methylisocitrate lyase, succinate dehydrogenase and acetohydroxylic acid synthase from Escherichia coli. Wherever undesirable (cancer, parasitic) cells differ from normal by more intense glycolysis and higher energy needs, there is a good chance of successful 3-BrPA use. However, this compound acts on all cells and it, therefore, seems that its future as a pharmaceutical is dependent upon the development of appropriate methods for its effective and safe application."

Like the bloodstream form of the closely related species Trypanosoma brucei, T. evansi depends exclusively on glycolysis for its free-energy generation. In T. evansi as in other kinetoplastid organisms, the enzymes of the major part of the glycolytic pathway are present within organelles called glycosomes, which are authentic but specialized peroxisomes. Since T. evansi does not undergo stage-dependent differentiations, it occurs only as bloodstream forms, it has been assumed that the metabolic pattern of this parasite is identical to that of the bloodstream form of T. brucei. However, we report here the presence of two additional enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and PPi-dependent pyruvate phosphate dikinase in T. evansi glycosomes. Their colocalization with glycolytic enzymes within the glycosomes of this parasite has not been reported before. Both enzymes can make use of PEP for contributing to the production of ATP within the organelles.

Although both parasites are presumed to be metabolically similar, insufficient knowledge of T. evansi precludes a full comparison. Herein, we provide the first report on the subcellular localisation of the glycolytic enzymes in T. evansi, which is a alike to that of the bloodstream form (BSF) of T. b. brucei: (i) fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase (glycolytic enzymes) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (a glycolysis-auxiliary enzyme) in glycosomes, (ii) enolase, phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase (glycolytic enzymes) and a GAPDH isoenzyme in the cytosol, (iii) malate dehydrogenase in cytosol and (iv) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in both glycosomes and the cytosol. Specific enzymatic activities also suggest that T. evansi is alike to the BSF of T. b. brucei in glycolytic flux, which is much faster than the pentose phosphate pathway flux, and in the involvement of cytosolic GAPDH in the NAD+/NADH balance. These similarities were expected based on the close phylogenetic relationship of both parasites."
160,Social motility of African trypanosomes is a property of a distinct life-cycle stage that occurs early in tsetse fly transmission.,10.1371/journal.ppat.1004493,2014-10-31,[],"The protozoan pathogen Trypanosoma brucei is transmitted between mammals by tsetse flies. The first compartment colonised by trypanosomes after a blood meal is the fly midgut lumen. Trypanosomes present in the lumen-designated as early procyclic forms-express the stage-specific surface glycoproteins EP and GPEET procyclin. When the trypanosomes establish a mature infection and colonise the ectoperitrophic space, GPEET is down-regulated, and EP becomes the major surface protein of late procyclic forms. A few years ago, it was discovered that procyclic form trypanosomes exhibit social motility (SoMo) when inoculated on a semi-solid surface. We demonstrate that SoMo is a feature of early procyclic forms, and that late procyclic forms are invariably SoMo-negative. In addition, we show that, apart from GPEET, other markers are differentially expressed in these two life-cycle stages, both in culture and in tsetse flies, indicating that they have different biological properties and should be considered distinct stages of the life cycle. Differentially expressed genes include two closely related adenylate cyclases, both hexokinases and calflagins. These findings link the phenomenon of SoMo in vitro to the parasite forms found during the first 4-7 days of a midgut infection. We postulate that ordered group movement on plates reflects the migration of parasites from the midgut lumen into the ectoperitrophic space within the tsetse fly. Moreover, the process can be uncoupled from colonisation of the salivary glands. Although they are the major surface proteins of procyclic forms, EP and GPEET are not essential for SoMo, nor, as shown previously, are they required for near normal colonisation of the fly midgut."

Ebselen (2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one, EbSe) was identified in a screen as a potent inhibitor of T. brucei hexokinase 1 (TbHK1), the first enzyme in the pathway. EbSe has a history of promiscuity as an enzyme inhibitor, inactivating proteins through seleno-sulfide conjugation with Cys residues. Indeed, dilution of TbHK1 and inhibitor following incubation did not temper inhibition suggesting conjugate formation. Using mass spectrometry to analyze EbSe-based modifications revealed that two Cys residues (C327 and C369) were oxidized after treatment. Site-directed mutagenesis of C327 led to enzyme inactivation indicating that C327 was essential for catalysis. C369 was not essential, suggesting that EbSe inhibition of TbHK1 was the consequence of modification of C327 via thiol oxidation. Additionally, neither EbSe treatment nor mutation of the nine TbHK1 Cys residues appreciably altered enzyme quaternary structure."

Peroxisomal biogenesis involves a cytosolic receptor, PEX5, which, after its insertion into the organellar membrane, delivers proteins to the matrix. In yeasts and mammalian cells, transient PEX5 monoubiquitination at the membrane serves as the signal for its retrieval from the organelle for re-use. When its recycling is impaired, PEX5 is polyubiquitinated for proteasomal degradation. Stably monoubiquitinated TbPEX5 was detected in cytosolic fractions of Trypanosoma brucei, indicative for its role as physiological intermediate in receptor recycling. This modification's resistance to dithiothreitol suggests ubiquitin conjugation of a lysine residue. T. brucei PEX4, the functional homologue of the ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) enzyme responsible for PEX5 monoubiquitination in yeast, was identified. It is associated with the cytosolic face of the glycosomal membrane, probably anchored by an identified putative TbPEX22. The involvement of TbPEX4 in TbPEX5 ubiquitination was demonstrated using procyclic ∆PEX4 trypanosomes. Surprisingly, glycosomal matrix protein import was only mildly affected in this mutant. Since other UBC homologues were upregulated, it might be possible that these have partially rescued PEX4's function in PEX5 ubiquitination. In addition, the altered expression of UBCs, notably of candidates involved in cell-cycle control, could be responsible for observed morphological and motility defects of the ∆PEX4 mutant."
163,Extra-glycosomal localisation of Trypanosoma brucei hexokinase 2.,10.1016/j.ijpara.2012.02.008,2012-05-24,[],"The majority of the glycolytic enzymes in the African trypanosome are compartmentalised within peroxisome-like organelles, the glycosomes. Polypeptides harbouring peroxisomal targeting sequences (PTS type 1 or 2) are targeted to these organelles. This targeting is essential to parasite viability, as compartmentalisation of glycolytic enzymes prevents unregulated ATP-dependent phosphorylation of intermediate metabolites. Here, we report the surprising extra-glycosomal localisation of a PTS-2 bearing trypanosomal hexokinase, TbHK2. In bloodstream form parasites, the protein localises to both glycosomes and to the flagellum. Evidence for this includes fractionation and immunofluorescence studies using antisera generated against the authentic protein as well as detection of epitope-tagged recombinant versions of the protein. In the insect stage parasite, distribution is different, with the polypeptide localised to glycosomes and proximal to the basal bodies. The function of the extra-glycosomal protein remains unclear. While its association with the basal body suggests that it may have a role in locomotion in the insect stage parasite, no detectable defect in directional motility or velocity of cell movement were observed for TbHK2-deficient cells, suggesting that the protein may have a different function in the cell."
164,Glycolysis in the african trypanosome: targeting enzymes and their subcellular compartments for therapeutic development.,10.4061/2011/123702,2011-11-18,[],"Subspecies of the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, which cause human African trypanosomiasis, are transmitted by the tsetse fly, with transmission-essential lifecycle stages occurring in both the insect vector and human host. During infection of the human host, the parasite is limited to using glycolysis of host sugar for ATP production. This dependence on glucose breakdown presents a series of targets for potential therapeutic development, many of which have been explored and validated as therapeutic targets experimentally. These include enzymes directly involved in glucose metabolism (e.g., the trypanosome hexokinases), as well as cellular components required for development and maintenance of the essential subcellular compartments that house the major part of the pathway, the glycosomes."
165,Glycerol 3-phosphate alters Trypanosoma brucei hexokinase activity in response to environmental change.,10.1074/jbc.M111.235705,2011-08-05,[],"The African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, compartmentalizes some metabolic enzymes within peroxisome-like organelles called glycosomes. The amounts, activities, and types of glycosomal enzymes are modulated coincident with developmental and environmental changes. Pexophagy (fusion of glycosomes with acidic lysosomes) has been proposed to facilitate this glycosome remodeling. Here, we report that, although glycosome-resident enzyme T. brucei hexokinase 1 (TbHK1) protein levels are maintained during pexophagy, acidification inactivates the activity. Glycerol 3-phosphate, which is produced in vivo by a glycosome-resident glycerol kinase, mitigated acid inactivation of lysate-derived TbHK activity. Using recombinant TbHK1, we found that glycerol 3-P influenced enzyme activity at pH 6.5 by preventing substrate and product inhibition by ATP and ADP, respectively. Additionally, TbHK1 inhibition by the flavonol quercetin (QCN) was partially reversed by glycerol 3-P at pH 7.4, whereas at pH 6.5, enzyme activity in the presence of QCN was completely maintained by glycerol 3-P. However, glycerol 3-P did not alter the interaction of QCN with TbHK1, as the lone Trp residue (Trp-177) was quenched under all conditions tested. These findings suggest potential novel mechanisms for the regulation of TbHK1, particularly given the acidification of glycosomes that can be induced under a variety of parasite growth conditions."
166,"Quercetin, a fluorescent bioflavanoid, inhibits Trypanosoma brucei hexokinase 1.",10.1016/j.exppara.2010.10.011,2010-10-26,[],"Hexokinases from the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, are attractive targets for the development of anti-parasitic drugs, in part because the parasite utilizes glycolysis exclusively for ATP production during the mammalian infection. Here, we have demonstrated that the bioflavanoid quercetin (QCN), a known trypanocide, is a mixed inhibitor of Trypanosoma brucei hexokinase 1 (TbHK1) (IC(50) = 4.1 ± 0.8μM). Spectroscopic analysis of QCN binding to TbHK1, taking advantage of the intrinsically fluorescent single tryptophan (Trp177) in TbHK1, revealed that QCN quenches emission of Trp177, which is located near the hinge region of the enzyme. ATP similarly quenched Trp177 emission, while glucose had no impact on fluorescence. Supporting the possibility that QCN toxicity is a consequence of inhibition of the essential hexokinase, in live parasites QCN fluorescence localizes to glycosomes, the subcellular home of TbHK1. Additionally, RNAi-mediated silencing of TbHK1 expression expedited QCN induced death, while over-expressing TbHK1 protected trypanosomes from the compound. In summary, these observations support the suggestion that QCN toxicity is in part attributable to inhibition of the essential TbHK1."
167,A target-based high throughput screen yields Trypanosoma brucei hexokinase small molecule inhibitors with antiparasitic activity.,10.1371/journal.pntd.0000659,2010-04-21,[],"The parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei utilizes glycolysis exclusively for ATP production during infection of the mammalian host. The first step in this metabolic pathway is mediated by hexokinase (TbHK), an enzyme essential to the parasite that transfers the gamma-phospho of ATP to a hexose. Here we describe the identification and confirmation of novel small molecule inhibitors of bacterially expressed TbHK1, one of two TbHKs expressed by T. brucei, using a high throughput screening assay.
Exploiting optimized high throughput screening assay procedures, we interrogated 220,233 unique compounds and identified 239 active compounds from which ten small molecules were further characterized. Computation chemical cluster analyses indicated that six compounds were structurally related while the remaining four compounds were classified as unrelated or singletons. All ten compounds were approximately 20-17,000-fold more potent than lonidamine, a previously identified TbHK1 inhibitor. Seven compounds inhibited T. brucei blood stage form parasite growth (0.03<or=EC(50)<3 microM) with parasite specificity of the compounds being demonstrated using insect stage T. brucei parasites, Leishmania promastigotes, and mammalian cell lines. Analysis of two structurally related compounds, ebselen and SID 17387000, revealed that both were mixed inhibitors of TbHK1 with respect to ATP. Additionally, both compounds inhibited parasite lysate-derived HK activity. None of the compounds displayed structural similarity to known hexokinase inhibitors or human African trypanosomiasis therapeutics.
The novel chemotypes identified here could represent leads for future therapeutic development against the African trypanosome."
168,Assembly of heterohexameric trypanosome hexokinases reveals that hexokinase 2 is a regulable enzyme.,10.1074/jbc.M802124200,2008-04-05,[],"Glycolysis is essential to Trypanosoma brucei, the protozoan parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. Hexokinase (HK), the first enzyme in glycolysis, catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to form glucose 6-phosphate. T. brucei harbors two HKs that are 98% identical at the amino acid level, T. brucei hexokinase 1 (TbHK1) and TbHK2. Recombinant TbHK1 (rTbHK1) has HK activity, whereas rTbHK2 does not. Unlike other eukaryotic HKs, TbHK1 is not subject to inhibition by ADP and glucose 6-phosphate. However, TbHK1 is inhibited by myristate, a critical fatty acid in T. brucei biology. We report here that rTbHKs, similar to authentic TbHK, form oligomers. Myristate dissociated these assemblies when incubated with either ATP or glucose. Furthermore, oligomer disruption was reversible by removal of myristate. Mixing of rTbHK1 and rTbHK2 monomers followed by reassembly yielded enzyme with an approximately 3-fold increase in specific activity compared with similarly treated rTbHK1 alone. Surprisingly, reassembly of rTbHK2 with an inactive rTbHK1 variant yielded an active HK, revealing for the first time that rTbHK2 is competent for HK activity. Finally, pyrophosphate inhibits active reassembled rTbHK2 oligomers but not oligomeric rTbHK1, suggesting that the two enzymes have distinct regulatory mechanisms."
169,The anti-trypanosomal agent lonidamine inhibits Trypanosoma brucei hexokinase 1.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2007.12.013,2008-02-12,[],"Glycolysis is essential to the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. The first step in this metabolic pathway is mediated by hexokinase, an enzyme that transfers the gamma-phosphate of ATP to a hexose. The T. brucei genome (TREU927/4 GUTat10.1) encodes two hexokinases (TbHK1 and TbHK2) that are 98% identical at the amino acid level. Our previous efforts have revealed that TbHK2 is an important regulator of TbHK1 in procyclic form parasites. Here, we have found through RNAi that TbHK1 is essential to the bloodstream form parasite. Silencing the gene for 4 days reduces cellular hexokinase approximately 60% and leads to parasite death. Additionally, we have found that the recombinant enzyme is inhibited by lonidamine (IC(50)=850 microM), an anti-cancer drug that targets tumor hexokinases. This agent also inhibits HK activity from whole parasite lysate (IC(50)=965 microM). Last, lonidamine is toxic to cultured bloodstream form parasites (LD(50)=50 microM) and procyclic form parasites (LD(50)=180 microM). Interestingly, overexpression of TbHK1 protects PF parasites from lonidamine. These studies provide genetic evidence that TbHK1 is a valid therapeutic target while identifying a potential molecular target of the anti-trypanosomal agent lonidamine."
170,Residues in an ATP binding domain influence sugar binding in a trypanosome hexokinase.,10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.10.192,2007-11-13,[],"Trypanosoma brucei harbors two hexokinases (TbHK1 and TbHK2) that are 98% identical at the amino acid level. We previously found that recombinant TbHK1 (rTbHK1) has hexokinase activity, while rTbHK2 has not, a finding attributed to differences in the C-termini of the proteins. Sequence analysis suggests that the C-termini of TbHKs are part of a newly identified conserved motif found in other eukaryotic hexokinases. Here, we have explored the role of tail residues in the differences in catalytic activity between TbHK1 and TbHK2. Our studies reveal that tail residues D454, F462, M466, and N469 are essential for HK activity while both I458 and V468 are required for catalysis and substrate specificity. To activate rTbHK2, all of the residues important for activity in rTbHK1 (D454, V458, F462, M466, V468, and N469) were required. These results indicate that the overall structure of the C-terminal tail influences the HK activity of rTbHK1."
171,Activity of a second Trypanosoma brucei hexokinase is controlled by an 18-amino-acid C-terminal tail.,10.1128/EC.00146-06,2006-10-10,[],"Trypanosoma brucei expresses two hexokinases that are 98% identical, namely, TbHK1 and TbHK2. Homozygous null TbHK2-/- procyclic-form parasites exhibit an increased doubling time, a change in cell morphology, and, surprisingly, a twofold increase in cellular hexokinase activity. Recombinant TbHK1 enzymatic activity is similar to that of other hexokinases, with apparent Km values for glucose and ATP of 0.09 +/- 0.02 mM and 0.28 +/- 0.1 mM, respectively. The k(cat) value for TbHK1 is 2.9 x 10(4) min(-1). TbHK1 can use mannose, fructose, 2-deoxyglucose, and glucosamine as substrates. In addition, TbHK1 is inhibited by fatty acids, with lauric, myristic, and palmitic acids being the most potent (with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 75.8, 78.4, and 62.4 microM, respectively). In contrast to TbHK1, recombinant TbHK2 lacks detectable enzymatic activity. Seven of the 10 amino acid differences between TbHK1 and TbHK2 lie within the C-terminal 18 amino acids of the polypeptides. Modeling of the proteins maps the C-terminal tails near the interdomain cleft of the enzyme that participates in the conformational change of the enzyme upon substrate binding. Replacing the last 18 amino acids of TbHK2 with the corresponding residues of TbHK1 yields an active recombinant protein with kinetic properties similar to those of TbHK1. Conversely, replacing the C-terminal tail of TbHK1 with the TbHK2 tail inactivates the enzyme. These findings suggest that the C-terminal tail of TbHK1 is important for hexokinase activity. The altered C-terminal tail of TbHK2, along with the phenotype of the knockout parasites, suggests a distinct function for the protein."
172,Inhibition of Trypanosoma cruzi hexokinase by bisphosphonates.,10.1021/jm0582625,2006-01-06,[],"Hexokinase is the first enzyme involved in glycolysis in most organisms, including the etiological agents of Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi) and African sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei). The T. cruzi enzyme is unusual since, unlike the human enzyme, it is inhibited by inorganic diphosphate (PPi). Here, we show that non-hydrolyzable analogues of PPi, bisphosphonates, are potent inhibitors of T. cruzi hexokinase (TcHK). We determined the activity of 42 bisphosphonates against TcHK, and the IC(50) values were used to construct pharmacophore and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) models for enzyme inhibition. Both models revealed the importance of electrostatic, hydrophobic, and steric interactions, and the IC(50) values for 17 active compounds were predicted with an average error of 2.4x by using the CoMSIA models. The compound most active against T. cruzi hexokinase was found to have a 2.2 microM IC(50) versus the clinically relevant intracellular amastigote form of T. cruzi, but only a approximately 1-2 mM IC(50) versus Dictyostelium discoideum and a human cell line, indicating selective activity versus T. cruzi."
174,"Probing the role of compartmentation of glycolysis in procyclic form Trypanosoma brucei: RNA interference studies of PEX14, hexokinase, and phosphofructokinase.",10.1074/jbc.M412033200,2005-01-08,[],"Trypanosoma brucei and related organisms contain an organelle evolutionarily related to peroxisomes that sequesters glycolysis, among other pathways. We have shown previously that disruption of protein import into this organelle, the glycosome, can be accomplished through RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of the peroxin PEX14. Decreased PEX14 in turn leads to cell death, which, at least in the procyclic stage, can be triggered by the presence of glucose. Here we show that fructose, which is taken up and metabolized by procyclic form T. brucei, and glycerol, which interfaces with the glycosomal glycolytic pathway, are also toxic during PEX14 RNAi. Earlier computer modeling studies predicted that glycolysis would be toxic to T. brucei in the absence of glycosomal compartmentation because of the intrinsic lack of feedback regulation of the parasite hexokinase and phosphofructokinase. To further test this hypothesis, we performed double RNAi, targeting hexokinase and PEX14. Knockdown of hexokinase rescued PEX14 knockdown cells from glucose toxicity, even though glycosomal proteins continue to be mislocalized to the cytosol. Knockdown of phosphofructokinase was benign in the absence of glucose but toxic in the presence of glucose. When PEX14 and phosphofructokinase mRNAs were jointly targeted for RNAi, glycerol remained toxic to the parasites. Taken together, these data indicate that the glycosome provides significant, but not complete, protection of trypanosomes from the dangerous design of glycolysis."
177,Molecular and biochemical characterization of hexokinase from Trypanosoma cruzi.,10.1016/s0166-6851(02)00294-3,2003-03-05,[],"The Trypanosoma cruzi hexokinase gene has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed as an active enzyme in Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis revealed 67% identity with its counterpart in Trypanosoma brucei but low similarity with all other available hexokinase sequences including those of human. It contains an N-terminal peroxisome-targeting signal (PTS-2) and has a calculated basic isoelectric point (pI = 9.67), a feature often associated with glycosomal proteins. The polypeptide has a predicted mass of approximately 50 kDa similar to that of many non-vertebrate hexokinases and the vertebrate hexokinase isoenzyme IV. The natural enzyme was purified to homogeneity from T. cruzi epimastigotes and appeared to exist in several aggregation states, an apparent tetramer being the predominant form. Its kinetic properties were compared with those of the purified recombinant protein. Higher K(m) values for glucose and ATP were found for the (His)(6)-tag-containing recombinant hexokinase. However, removal of the tag produced an enzyme displaying similar values as the natural enzyme (K(m) for glucose = 43 and 60 microM for the natural and the recombinant protein, respectively). None of these enzymes presented activity with fructose. As reported previously for hexokinases from several trypanosomatids, no inhibition was exerted by glucose 6-phosphate (G6-P). In contrast, a mixed-type inhibition was observed with inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi, K(i) = 0.5mM)."
178,Extramitochondrial localization of NADH-fumarate reductase in trypanosomatids.,10.1016/s1096-4959(02)00094-5,2002-09-12,[],"Trypanosoma brucei procyclic trypomastigotes and T. cruzi epimastigotes (both Tulahuen and Y strains) were permeabilized by incubation with increasing amounts of digitonin, causing enzymes to be released from different intracellular compartments. After 10 min incubation with digitonin, the cells were centrifuged and the activity of marker enzymes (aspartate-dependent malic enzyme for cytoplasm, hexokinase for glycosomes and either isocitrate dehydrogenase or citrate synthase for mitochondria) was analyzed in the supernatant. The results were compared with the release of NADH-fumarate reductase in order to determine if this enzyme was preferentially released with a specific intracellular marker. Fumarate reductase was released at lower digitonin concentration than those required to either release isocitrate dehydrogenase or citrate synthase. Similarly, Leishmania donovani promastigotes (S-2 strain) were exposed to a single concentration of digitonin (200 micro M) but in this case we monitored the release of fumarate reductase and hexokinase, while monitoring the mitochondrial membrane potential (using safranine O). Again, substantial fumarate reductase and hexokinase activities were released without loss of mitochondrial membrane potential indicating that part of the enzyme was released while the inner mitochondrial membrane remained intact. These results suggest that, in the three species of trypanosomatids the enzyme fumarate reductase is, at least in part, located outside the mitochondrial matrix."
179,Glycolysis modulates trypanosome glycoprotein expression as revealed by an RNAi library.,10.1093/emboj/cdf474,2002-08-29,[],"RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool for identifying gene function in Trypanosoma brucei. We generated an RNAi library, the first of its kind in any organism, by ligation of genomic fragments into the vector pZJMbeta. After transfection at approximately 5-fold genome coverage, trypanosomes were induced to express double-stranded RNA and screened for reduced con canavalin A (conA) binding. Since this lectin binds the surface glycoprotein EP-procyclin, we predicted that cells would lose affinity to conA if RNAi silenced genes affecting EP-procyclin expression or modification. We found a cell line in which RNAi switches expression from glycosylated EP-procyclins to the unglycosylated GPEET-procyclin. This switch results from silencing a hexokinase gene. The relationship between procyclin expression and glycolysis was supported by silencing other genes in the glycolytic pathway, and confirmed by observation of a similar upregulation of GPEET- procyclin when parental cells were grown in medium depleted of glucose. These data suggest that T.brucei 'senses' changes in glucose level and modulates procyclin expression accordingly."
180,"Sequencing, modeling, and selective inhibition of Trypanosoma brucei hexokinase.",10.1016/s1074-5521(02)00169-2,2002-07-30,[],"For Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite responsible for African sleeping sickness, carbohydrate metabolism is the only source of ATP, and glycolytic enzymes are localized within membrane-bound organelles called glycosomes. Hexokinase, the first enzyme of the glycolytic pathway, was chosen as a target for selective drug design. We have cloned and sequenced the hexokinase gene of T. brucei. In parallel, we have synthesized several inhibitors. Kinetic analysis revealed differences in the binding mode of these compounds toward yeast and T. brucei hexokinases, while the m-bromophenyl glucosamide was found to be selective for T. brucei. The modeled structure of T. brucei hexokinase-inhibitor complex (using the crystal structure of the Schistosoma mansoni hexokinase as a template) allows us to propose a mode of action of this inhibitor for the trypanosome hexokinase and to account for the observed selectivity."
181,Compartmentation protects trypanosomes from the dangerous design of glycolysis.,10.1073/pnas.030539197,2000-02-19,[],"Unlike in other organisms, in trypanosomes and other Kinetoplastida the larger part of glycolysis takes place in a specialized organelle, called the glycosome. At present it is impossible to remove the glycosome without changing much of the rest of the cell. It would seem impossible, therefore, to assess the metabolic consequences of this compartmentation. Therefore, we here develop a computer experimentation approach, which we call computational cell biology. A validated molecular kinetic computer replica was built of glycolysis in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Removing the glycosome membrane in that replica had little effect on the steady-state flux, which argues against the prevalent speculation that glycosomes serve to increase flux by concentrating the enzymes. Removal of the membrane did cause (i) the sugar phosphates to rise to unphysiologically high levels, which must have pathological effects, and (ii) a failure to recover from glucose deprivation. We explain these effects on the basis of the biochemical organization of the glycosome. We conclude (i) that the glycosome protects trypanosomes from the negative side effects of the ""turbo"" structure of glycolysis and (ii) that computer experimentation based on solid molecular data is a powerful tool to address questions that are not, or not yet, accessible to experimentation."
183,"Purification, localisation and characterisation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase of Trypanosoma brucei.",10.1016/s0166-6851(98)00176-5,1999-04-24,[],"Cell-fractionation and digitonin titration of procyclic trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma brucei, revealed that almost half of the total NADP+ -dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity, the first enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), is associated with glycosomes. The specific activity of G6PDH in the purified organelles was increased 4-fold relative to a total cell extract and showed latency. Moreover, in the absence of detergents this activity was totally resistant to the action of trypsin. The cytosolic counterpart was neither latent, nor was it resistant to trypsin. Both cytosolic and glycosomal G6PDH activities behaved identically on phenyl-, CM-, heparin-, and Affigel-blue-Sepharose columns. Both isoenzymes had a subunit Mr of 62 000 and an isoelectric point of 6.85, while kinetic studies carried out on the partially purified G6PDH from both cell compartments did not reveal any differences. The purified enzyme had an apparent Km of 138 and 5.3 microM for glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), and for NADP+, respectively, and had a specific activity of 14 micromol. (min mg of protein)(-1). We conclude that while in procyclic stages of T. brucei G6PDH activity is present in two different cell compartments, i.e. the cytosol and the glycosomes, these two activities most likely represent one and the same isoenzyme."
184,Glossina morsitans morsitans and Glossina palpalis palpalis: dosage compensation raises questions about the Milligan model for control of trypanosome development.,10.1006/expr.1998.4332,1998-11-10,[],"Evidence that dosage compensation occurs in tsetse flies was obtained by comparing the activities of X chromosome-linked enzymes, arginine phosphokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in Glossina m. morsitans and hexokinase and phosphoglucomutase in Glossina p. palpalis, with the activity of an autosome-linked enzyme, malate dehydrogenase, in each species. The shortcomings of the X chromosome model for the control of Trypanozoon maturation in tsetse are discussed in light of these findings and previously published reports on the lack of fitness effects of mature Trypanozoon infections in tsetse and on published results on antitrypanosomal factors in male and female tsetse flies."
191,Selective interaction of glycosomal enzymes from Trypanosoma brucei with hydrophobic cyclic hexapeptides.,10.1006/bbrc.1993.2097,1993-09-15,[],"Hydrophobic cyclic hexapeptides have been reported to selectively inhibit glycosomal triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei (Kuntz et al, 1992, Eur. J. Biochem., 207, 441-447). Here it is shown that this inhibition is not due to a specific interaction between the enzyme and soluble hydrophobic cyclic hexapeptides, but that it is the result of a coprecipitation of trypanosome triosephosphate isomerase with cyclic hexapeptides when the solubilities of the latter are exceeded. A study of the interaction of these hexapeptides with other glycosomal enzymes revealed that several of them, such as phosphoglycerate kinase and hexokinase, also coprecipitated with these peptides, whereas most of the homologous enzymes from other organisms did not coprecipitate, nor were they inactivated."
193,Characterization of carbohydrate metabolism and demonstration of glycosomes in a Phytomonas sp. isolated from Euphorbia characias.,10.1016/0166-6851(92)90111-v,1992-09-01,[],"Phytomonas sp. isolated from Euphorbia characias was adapted to SDM-79 medium. Cells isolated in the early stationary phase of growth were analyzed for their capacity to utilize plant carbohydrates for their energy requirements. The cellulose-degrading enzymes amylase, amylomaltase, invertase, carboxymethylcellulase, and the pectin-degrading enzymes polygalacturonase and oligo-D-galactosiduronate lyase were present in Phytomonas sp. and were all, except for amylomaltase, excreted into the external medium. Glucose, fructose and mannose served as the major energy substrates. Catabolism of carbohydrates occurred mainly via aerobic glycolysis according to the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, of which all the enzymes were detected. Likewise, the end-products of glycolysis, acetate and pyruvate, glycerol, succinate and ethanol were detected in the culture medium, as were the enzymes responsible for their production. Mitochondria were incapable of oxidizing succinate, 2-oxoglutarate, pyruvate, malate and proline, but had a high capacity to oxidize glycerol 3-phosphate. This oxidation was completely inhibited by salicylhydroxamic acid. No cytochromes could be detected either in intact mitochondria or in sub-mitochondrial particles. Mitochondrial respiration was not inhibited by antimycin, azide or cyanide. The glycolytic enzymes, from hexokinase to phosphoglycerate kinase, and the enzymes glycerol kinase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase and adenylate kinase, were all associated with glycosomes that had a buoyant density of about 1.24 g cm-1 in sucrose. Cytochemical staining revealed the presence of catalase in these organelles. The cytosolic enzyme pyruvate kinase was activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, typical of all other pyruvate kinases from Kinetoplastida. The energy metabolism of the plant parasite Phytomonas sp. isolated from E. characias resembled that of the bloodstream form of the mammalian parasite Trypanosoma brucei."
194,"Comparative physiology of two protozoan parasites, Leishmania donovani and Trypanosoma brucei, grown in chemostats.",10.1128/jb.174.9.2929-2934.1992,1992-05-01,[],"Cultures of the insect stage of the protozoan parasites Leishmania donovani and Trypanosoma brucei were grown in chemostats with glucose as the growth rate-limiting substrate. L. donovani has a maximum specific growth rate (mu max) of 1.96 day-1 and a Ks for glucose of 0.1 mM; the mu max of T. brucei is 1.06 day-1 and the Ks is 0.06 mM. At each steady state (specific growth rate, mu, equals D, the dilution rate), the following parameters were measured: external glucose concentration (Glcout), cell density, dry weight, protein, internal glucose concentration (Glcin), cellular ATP level, and hexokinase activity. L. donovani shows a relationship between mu and yield that allows an estimation of the maintenance requirement (ms) and the yield per mole of ATP (YATP). Both the ms and the YATP are on the higher margin of the range found for prokaryotes grown on glucose in a complex medium. L. donovani maintains the Glcin at a constant level of about 50 mM as long as it is not energy depleted. T. brucei has a decreasing yield with increasing mu, suggesting that it oxidizes its substrate to a lesser extent at higher growth rates. Glucose is not concentrated internally but is taken up by facilitated diffusion, while phosphorylation by hexokinase is probably the rate-limiting step for glucose metabolism. The Ks is constant as long as glucose is the rate-limiting substrate. The results of this study demonstrate that L. donovani and T. brucei have widely different metabolic strategies for dealing with varying external conditions, which reflect the conditions they are likely to encounter in their respective insect hosts."
198,The enzymes of the classical pentose phosphate pathway display differential activities in procyclic and bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0014-5793(89)81154-8,1989-02-13,[],"The specific activities of each of the enzymes of the classical pentose phosphate pathway have been determined in both cultured procyclic and bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei. Both forms contained glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49), 6-phosphogluconolactonase (EC 3.1.1.31), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.44), ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.6) and transaldolase (EC 2.2.1.2). However, ribulose-5-phosphate 3'-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.1) and transketolase (EC 2.2.1.1) activities were detectable only in procyclic forms. These results clearly demonstrate that both forms of T. brucei can metabolize glucose via the oxidative segment of the classical pentose phosphate pathway in order to produce D-ribose-5-phosphate for the synthesis of nucleic acids and reduced NADP for other synthetic reactions. However, only procyclic forms are capable of using the non-oxidative segment of the classical pentose phosphate pathway to cycle carbon between pentose and hexose phosphates in order to produce D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as a net product of the pathway. Both forms lack the key gluconeogenic enzyme, fructose-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11). Consequently, neither form should be able to engage in gluconeogenesis nor should procyclic forms be able to return any of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced in the pentose phosphate pathway to glucose 6-phosphate. This last specific metabolic arrangement and the restriction of all but the terminal steps of glycolysis to the glycosome may be the observations required to explain the presence of distinct cytosolic and glycosomal isoenzymes of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase. These same observations also may provide the basis for explaining the presence of cytosolic hexokinase and phosphoglucose isomerase without the presence of any cytosolic phosphofructokinase activity. The key enzymes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.12) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.14) were not detected in either procyclic or bloodstream forms of T. brucei."
199,An improved purification of glycosomes from the procyclic trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(86)90126-x,1986-12-01,[],"The glycosomes of in vitro grown procyclic trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma brucei were purified by three different procedures and the results compared by electron microscopy, enzyme assays and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Centrifugation on a self-forming Percoll gradient followed by a sucrose gradient centrifugation resulted in the least enriched glycosomal preparation. Centrifugation on a pre-formed Nycodenz gradient gave an improved preparation but the most homogeneous preparation of intact glycosomes was obtained after centrifugation on two successive sucrose gradients. Glycosomes purified by both the Nycodenz and double sucrose gradient procedures appeared larger than in situ glycosomes presumably due to an osmotic effect resulting from disruption of the granular matrix of the organelles. Nevertheless, there appears to be no loss of cisternal contents due to the swelling of the organelles. The glycosomes of the bloodstream form trypomastigotes purified by the same procedures show, however, no sign of swelling. A comparison of glycosomes purified from procyclic trypomastigotes and bloodstream form trypomastigotes prepared by the same double sucrose procedure demonstrated that in the glycosome of procyclic trypomastigotes: activities of hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructose kinase, aldolase and phosphoglycerate kinase and diminished by 80-100%; activities of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase remain unchanged or are only slightly reduced; there is an appearance of four major new proteins, among which could be phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase and malate dehydrogenase. These observations are in basic agreement with those by Hart et al. (Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 12, 25-35, 1984)."
200,Inhibitory action of the antitumor agent lonidamine on mitochondrial respiration of Trypanosoma cruzi and T. brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(86)90104-0,1986-09-01,[],"The antitumor and antispermatogenic agent lonidamine inhibits Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes growth in culture with an ID50 around 80 microM. The main site of action appears to be the mitochondria, where the rate of uncoupled respiration was inhibited in 50% at a similar lonidamine concentration (50 microM). Hexokinase (the other point where lonidamine inhibits tumor energy metabolism) was not sensitive to this drug. Lonidamine also inhibited uncoupled respiration in T. brucei procyclic trypomastigotes, suggesting a common mechanism of action with T. cruzi. When lonidamine was added to T. brucei trypomastigotes, there was little effect on the CN-insensitive respiration, demonstrating that at least in T. brucei glycolysis is not affected by the drug."
201,"Glycolytic enzymes of Trypanosoma brucei. Simultaneous purification, intraglycosomal concentrations and physical properties.",10.1111/j.1432-1033.1986.tb09687.x,1986-06-02,[],"We have developed a method for the simultaneous purification of hexokinase, glucosephosphate isomerase, phosphofructokinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, D-glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerol kinase from Trypanosoma brucei in yields varying over 8-55%. Crude glycosomes were prepared by differential centrifugation of cell homogenates. Subsequent hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose resulted in six pools containing various mixtures of enzymes. These pools were processed via affinity chromatography (immobilized ATP), hydrophobic interaction chromatography (octyl-Sepharose) and ion-exchange chromatography (CM- and DEAE-cellulose) which resulted in the purification of all nine enzymes. The native enzyme and subunit molecular masses, as determined by gel filtration and gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, were compared with those of their homologous counterparts from other organisms. Trypanosomal hexokinase is a hexamer and differs in subunit composition from the mammalian enzymes (monomers) as well as in subunit size (51 kDa versus 96-100 kDa, respectively). Phosphofructokinase only differs in subunit size (51 kDa for T. brucei versus 80-90 kDa for mammals) but had identical subunit composition (tetrameric). The others all have the same subunit composition as their mammalian counterparts. Except for triosephosphate isomerase, all Trypanosoma enzymes have subunits which are 1-5 kDa larger in size. Together these nine enzymes contribute 3.3 +/- 1.6% to the total cellular protein of T. brucei and at least 90% to the total glycosomal protein. A comparison of calculated intraglycosomal concentrations of the enzymes with the glycosomal metabolite concentrations shows that in the case of aldolase, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase, the concentration of active sites is of the same order of magnitude as that of their reactants. A common feature of the glycosomal glycolytic enzymes (with the exception of glucosephosphate isomerase) is that they are highly basic proteins with pI values between 8.8 and 10.2, values which are 1-4 higher than in the case of their mammalian cytosolic counterparts and 3-6 higher than in the case of the various unicellular organisms. It is suggested that both the larger subunit size and the basic character of the T. brucei glycolytic proteins are involved in the routing of the enzymes from their site of biogenesis (the cytosol) towards their site of action (the glycosome)."

As a first step, the glycosomes, microbody-like organelles of Trypanosomatidae, containing almost exclusively enzymes involved in glucose and glycerol metabolism [Opperdoes, F. R. and Borst, P. (1977) FEBS Lett. 80, 360-364], were purified eightfold from homogenates with an average yield of 38%. Subsequently, the glycosomal content was subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose. This step results in pure hexokinase (15% final yield) and almost pure triosephosphate isomerase, while the other glycosomal enzymes elute as mixtures of two or three enzymes. Triosephosphate isomerase was further purified to homogeneity on CM-cellulose (33% final yield), while phosphoglycerate kinase and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase were separated from each other and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography using ATP-Sepharose (25% and 30% final yields, respectively). Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase was further characterized as a typical class I enzyme."

A comparison of the specific activities of glycosomal enzymes revealed that glycosomes from insect stages had decreased levels of hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phospho-fructokinase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase, but contained increased levels of adenylate kinase, malate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Glycosomes from bloodstream forms were almost totally devoid of the latter two activities. Comparison of the two types of glycosomes by sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that bloodstream form glycosomes contained 3 prominent polypeptides (64, 46 and 40 kDa) which were hardly detectable in insect stage glycosomes, whereas the latter contained 3 insect stage specific bands with molecular weight of 34 000, 61 000 and 77 000 and 4 additional bands with molecular weights between 94 000 and 110 000. Both types of glycosome contained the phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Insect stage glycosomes contained in addition also phosphatidylinositol and some phosphatidylserine."

Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is mitochondrial in mammals, but the isofunctional enzyme, dihydroorotate oxidase was found to be cytoplasmic, whereas orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which are cytoplasmic in mammals, were found to be particulate. Analysis by isopycnic sedimentation in sucrose showed that both particulate enzymes co-sedimented with glycosomal-(microbody-)marker enzymes such as hexokinase. Electron microscopy indicated that fractions containing these activities consisted essentially only of microbodies. It is concluded therefore that these enzymes are associated with glycosomes. Kinetic studies with intact glycosomal preparations suggested that there was no membrane barrier between 5-phosphoribose 1-pyrophosphate (P-Rib-PP) and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, indicating either that the active site of this enzyme is probably on the outside of the glycosome or that the glycosome may have an efficient transport site for P-Rib-PP. Not all the UMP salvage enzymes assayed were detected. No uridine kinase activity was found in any of the species investigated, suggesting that uridine salvage might be routed via a uridine phosphorylase and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase. In agreement with this suggestion, these latter activities were detected in all organisms tested except the intracellular amastigote form of T. cruzi, where uracil phosphoribosyltransferase appeared absent. All the UMP salvage enzymes investigated occurred in cytoplamic fractions."

The enzyme activities in the procyclics were compared with those of the blood stream forms. The specific activities of glycolytic enzymes represented 30-70% of the respective levels in the blood stream form, except for hexokinase which was 25-fold reduced. Cell fractionation showed that the enzymes involved in the early sequence of the glycolytic pathway, i.e. from hexokinase to phosphoglycerate kinase, and the enzymes NAD+-linked glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerol kinase were all present in glycosomes equilibrating at a density of 1.23 g/cm3 in sucrose gradients. Malate dehydrogenase was 8-fold more active in procyclics than in bloodstream forms. This increase in activity was the result of the appearance of malate dehydrogenase in the glycosomes of the procyclics, in addition to mitochondrial and cell-sap activities which were present in both stages of the life cycle. Glycosomes contained part of the adenylate kinase activity, which was also associated with the mitochondrion. Succinate dehydrogenase and sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, together with oligomycin-sensitive ATPase, were located in the mitochondrion which had a density in sucrose ranging from 1.16 to 1.18 g/cm3. This organelle also contained L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase and carnitine acetyltransferase, two enzymes involved in threonine catabolism. The latter two enzymes had activities which were, respectively, 15-and 13-fold higher in the procyclics than in the bloodstream form. Mitochondrial sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was decreased 4-fold."

A post large-granule extract is subjected to density-gradient centrifugation on isotonic Percoll in a vertical rotor. This results in a good separation of the glycosomes, which equilibrated at 1.09 g/cm3, from other cellular components. Glycosomes isolated from such a gradient are 9-fold purified relative to the starting homogenate with a yield of 25%. Their glycolytic enzymes exhibit a high latency indicative of an intact glycosomal membrane."
212,Studies on glycerol kinase and its role in ATP synthesis in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(80)90033-x,1980-12-01,[],"Glycerol kinase of Trypanosoma brucei has been shown to be capable of catalysing sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dependent ADP phosphorylation for ATP generation. The rate of this reaction (Vr) is sufficient to account for the observed rate of glycerol production from anaerobic glucose metabolism by intact cells and to account for net ATP synthesis. Glycerol kinase has been purified by preparing a post-nuclear, particulate fraction and solubilizing the enzyme with 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100. This treatment results in a 3.5-fold increase in total activity, demonstrating the latent nature of particulate glycerol kinase, and an overall 10-fold increase in specific activity in the soluble fraction. The ratio of the velocities of the forward (Vf) reverse (Vr) reactions of this enzyme is altered from 21 to 170 upon solubilization. The Michaelis constants for the solubilized enzyme are KmADP = 0.12 +/- 0.04 mM, KmG-3-P = 5.12 +/- 1.47 mM, Kmglycerol = 0.12 +/- 0.05 and KmATP = 0.19 +/- 0.04 mM. Endogenous hexokinase acts as an ATP trap favouring ATP synthesis sn-glycerol-3-phosphate and ADP. This can be demonstrated in reconstituted systems using trypanosome glycerol kinase and varying hexokinase activities. Mass action inhibition of ATP synthesis by glycerol is more marked with lower hexokinase activities. High glycerol kinase activity (> 0.5 mumol/min/mg protein) has been found in the T. brucei complex of trypanosomes that produce glycerol anaerobically whereas only low activities (less than or equal to 0.03 mumol/min/mg protein) are present in Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma lewisi and Crithidia fasciculata, organisms that do not produce glycerol. Trypanosoma congolense has a glycerol kinase activity of 0.17 mumol/min/mg protein and shows poorer ATP synthesis from anaerobic glucose metabolism than organisms of the T. brucei complex."
214,Glycolysis in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1980.tb05988.x,1980-02-01,[],"The possibility that the glycosomes present in the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei [Opperdoes, F. R. and Borst, P. (1977) FEBS Lett. 80, 360--364] constitute a separate pool of glycolytic intermediates within the cell was investigated. In titrations of intact cells with digitonin, a differential activation of glycolytic enzymes was observed. Enolase, pyruvate kinase and the cell-sap marker alanine aminotransferase were activated at 0.05 mg digitonin per mg protein. The nine glycosomal enzymes involved in the conversion of glucose and glycerol into 3-phosphoglycerate were activated only at digitonin concentrations between 0.7 and 9.8 mg/mg protein. In subcellular fractions the activities of the latter enzymes were all latent between 70 and 92%. Latency was abolished by addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 or partly by five cycles of freezing and thawing. We conclude that the glycosomal enzymes are surrounded by a membrane, which forms a permeability barrier to intermediates and co-factors of glycolysis. The concentrations of glycolytic intermediates and of adenine nucleotides were measured under aerobic conditions as well as in the presence of 1 mM salicylhydroxamic acid, a respiratory inhibitor. Addition of salicylhydroxamic acid caused the following changes: (a) The levels of almost all glycolytic intermediates measured decreased. Glycerol-3-phosphate, however, increased fourfold. (b) The phosphate potential was drastically lowered from 2900 to 450 M-1. (c) The trypanosomes became more reduced, as monitored by a change in the apparent redox state of the NADH/NAD+ courple from E'h = -189 to E'h = -219 mV. From the high levels of metabolite concentrations found and from comparison of the apparent mass-action ratios calculated for the separate glycolytic reactions with those for other organisms, we conclude that in bloodstream form T. brucei the glycolytic intermediates are present in the glycosomes as well as in the cytosol and that the two pools of intermediates equilibrate with each other, despite the presence of the glycosomal membrane."

While the human form (HAT) is now limited to foci, the animal form (AAT) is widespread and affects the majority of sub-Saharan African countries, and constitutes a real obstacle to the development of animal breeding. The control of AAT is hampered by a lack of standardized and easy-to used diagnosis tools. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of TbLysoPLA and TbGK proteins from Trypanosoma brucei brucei for AAT serodiagnosis in indirect ELISA using experimental and field sera, individually, in combination, and associated with the BiP C-terminal domain (C25) from T. congolense. These novel proteins were characterized in silico, and their sequence analysis showed strong identities with their orthologs in other trypanosomes (more than 60% for TbLysoPLA and more than 82% for TbGK). TbLysoPLA displays a low homology with cattle (<35%) and Piroplasma (<15%). However, TbGK shares more than 58% with cattle and between 45-55% with Piroplasma. We could identify seven predicted epitopes on TbLysoPLA sequence and 14 potential epitopes on TbGK. Both proteins were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. Their diagnostic potential was evaluated by ELISA with sera from cattle experimentally infected with T. congolense and with T.b. brucei, sera from cattle naturally infected with T. congolense, T. vivax and T.b. brucei. Both proteins used separately had poor diagnostic performance. However, used together with the BiP protein, they showed 60% of sensitivity and between 87-96% of specificity, comparable to reference ELISA tests. In conclusion, we showed that the performance of the protein combinations is much better than the proteins tested individually for the diagnosis of AAT."

The enzyme dihydroxyacetone kinase (DAK) has shown to be involved in DHA detoxification and osmoregulation. Among protozoa of the genus Trypanosoma, T. brucei, which causes sleeping sickness, is highly sensitive to DHA and does not have orthologous genes to DAK. Conversely, T. cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas Disease, has two putative ATP-dependent DAK (TcDAKs) sequences in its genome. Here we show that T. cruzi epimastigote lysates present a DAK specific activity of 27.1 nmol/min/mg of protein and that this form of the parasite is able to grow in the presence of 2 mM DHA.

This strategy resulted in a much-enhanced anti-parasite effect, which we ascribed to the greater accumulation of the compound at the location of the target protein, i.e. the mitochondrion, but to date this localization has not been formally established. We therefore synthesized a series of fluorescent analogues to visualize accumulation and distribution within the cell. The fluorophore chosen, julolidine, has the remarkable extra feature of being able to function as a viscosity sensor and might thus additionally act as a probe of the cellular glycerol that is expected to be produced when TAO is inhibited. Two series of fluorescent inhibitor conjugates incorporating a cationic julolidine-based viscosity sensor were synthesized and their photophysical and biological properties were studied. These probes display a red emission, with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), using both single- and two-photon excitation. Upon incubation with T. brucei and mammalian cells, the fluorescent inhibitors 1a and 2a were taken up selectively in the mitochondria as shown by live-cell imaging. Efficient partition of 1a in functional isolated (rat liver) mitochondria was estimated to 66 ± 20% of the total. The compounds inhibited recombinant TAO enzyme in the submicromolar (1a, 2c, 2d) to low nanomolar range (2a) and were effective against WT and multidrug-resistant trypanosome strains (B48, AQP1-3 KO) in the submicromolar range. Good selectivity (SI > 29) over mammalian HEK cells was observed. However, no viscosity-related shift could be detected, presumably because the glycerol was produced cytosolically, and released through aquaglyceroporins, whereas the probe was located, virtually exclusively, in the trypanosome's mitochondrion."

The AQP family is highly conserved, with two major subfamilies having arisen very early in prokaryote evolution and retained by eukaryotes. A complex evolutionary history indicates multiple lineage-specific expansions, losses and not uncommonly a complete loss. Consequently, the AQP family is highly evolvable and has been associated with significant events in life on Earth. In the African trypanosomes, a role for the AQP2 paralogue, in sensitivity to two chemotherapeutic agents, pentamidine and melarsoprol, is well established, albeit with the mechanisms for cell entry and resistance unclear until very recently. Here, we discuss AQP evolution, structure and mechanisms by which AQPs impact drug sensitivity, suggesting that AQP2 stability is highly sensitive to mutation while serving as the major uptake pathway for pentamidine."

Sensitivity of African trypanosomes to pentamidine and melarsoprol is predominantly mediated by aquaglyceroporin 2 (TbAQP2), a channel associated with water/glycerol transport. TbAQP2 is expressed at the flagellar pocket membrane and chimerisation with TbAQP3 renders parasites resistant to both drugs. Two models for how TbAQP2 mediates pentamidine sensitivity have emerged; that TbAQP2 mediates pentamidine translocation across the plasma membrane or via binding to TbAQP2, with subsequent endocytosis and presumably transport across the endosomal/lysosomal membrane, but as trafficking and regulation of TbAQPs is uncharacterised this remains unresolved. We demonstrate that TbAQP2 is organised as a high order complex, is ubiquitylated and is transported to the lysosome. Unexpectedly, mutation of potential ubiquitin conjugation sites, i.e. cytoplasmic-oriented lysine residues, reduced folding and tetramerization efficiency and triggered ER retention. Moreover, TbAQP2/TbAQP3 chimerisation, as observed in pentamidine-resistant parasites, also leads to impaired oligomerisation, mislocalisation and increased turnover. These data suggest that TbAQP2 stability is highly sensitive to mutation and that instability contributes towards the emergence of drug resistance."

Myo-inositol (inositol), an important compound in the pharmaceutics, cosmetics and food industries, is usually produced from phytate via a harsh set of chemical reactions. Recombinant Escherichia coli strains have been constructed by metabolic engineering strategies to produce inositol, but with a low yield. The proper distribution of carbon flux between cell growth and inositol production is a major challenge for constructing an efficient inositol-synthesis pathway in bacteria. Construction of metabolically engineered E. coli strains with high stoichiometric yield of inositol is desirable.
In the present study, we designed an inositol-synthesis pathway from glucose with a theoretical stoichiometric yield of 1 mol inositol/mol glucose. Recombinant E. coli strains with high stoichiometric yield (> 0.7 mol inositol/mol glucose) were obtained. Inositol was successfully biosynthesized after introducing two crucial enzymes: inositol-3-phosphate synthase (IPS) from Trypanosoma brucei, and inositol monophosphatase (IMP) from E. coli. Based on starting strains E. coli BW25113 (wild-type) and SG104 (ΔptsG::glk, ΔgalR::zglf, ΔpoxB::acs), a series of engineered strains for inositol production was constructed by deleting the key genes pgi, pfkA and pykF. Plasmid-based expression systems for IPS and IMP were optimized, and expression of the gene zwf was regulated to enhance the stoichiometric yield of inositol. The highest stoichiometric yield (0.96 mol inositol/mol glucose) was achieved from recombinant strain R15 (SG104, Δpgi, Δpgm, and RBSL5-zwf). Strain R04 (SG104 and Δpgi) reached high-density in a 1-L fermenter when using glucose and glycerol as a mixed carbon source. In scaled-up fed-batch bioconversion in situ using strain R04, 0.82 mol inositol/mol glucose was produced within 23 h, corresponding to a titer of 106.3 g/L (590.5 mM) inositol.
The biosynthesis of inositol from glucose in recombinant E. coli was optimized by metabolic engineering strategies. The metabolically engineered E. coli strains represent a promising method for future inositol production. This study provides an essential reference to obtain a suitable distribution of carbon flux between glycolysis and inositol synthesis."

Available treatments for this devastating disease are few and have limited efficacy, prompting the search for new drug candidates. Simultaneous inhibition of the trypanosomal glycerol kinase (TGK) and trypanosomal alternative oxidase (TAO) is considered a validated strategy toward the development of new drugs. Our goal is to develop a TGK-specific inhibitor for coadministration with ascofuranone (AF), the most potent TAO inhibitor. Here, we report on the identification of novel compounds with inhibitory potency against TGK. Importantly, one of these compounds (compound 17) and its derivatives (17a and 17b) killed trypanosomes even in the absence of AF. Inhibition kinetics revealed that derivative 17b is a mixed-type and competitive inhibitor for TGK and TAO, respectively. Structural data revealed the molecular basis of this dual inhibitory action, which, in our opinion, will aid in the successful development of a promising drug to treat trypanosomiasis.

In these conditions, the parasite needs to produce glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) through gluconeogenesis from metabolism of non-glycolytic carbon source(s). We showed here that two phosphoenolpyruvate-producing enzymes, PEP carboxykinase (PEPCK) and pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) have a redundant function for the essential gluconeogenesis from proline. Indeed, incorporation of 13C-enriched proline into G6P was abolished in the PEPCK/PPDK null double mutant (Δppdk/Δpepck), but not in the single Δppdk and Δpepck mutant cell lines. The procyclic trypanosome also uses the glycerol conversion pathway to feed gluconeogenesis, since the death of the Δppdk/Δpepck double null mutant in glucose-free conditions is only observed after RNAi-mediated down-regulation of the expression of the glycerol kinase, the first enzyme of the glycerol conversion pathways. Deletion of the gene encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Δfbpase), a key gluconeogenic enzyme irreversibly producing fructose 6-phosphate from fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, considerably reduced, but not abolished, incorporation of 13C-enriched proline into G6P. In addition, the Δfbpase cell line is viable in glucose-free conditions, suggesting that an alternative pathway can be used for G6P production in vitro. However, FBPase is essential in vivo, as shown by the incapacity of the Δfbpase null mutant to colonise the fly vector salivary glands, while the parental phenotype is restored in the Δfbpase rescued cell line re-expressing FBPase. The essential role of FBPase for the development of T. brucei in the tsetse was confirmed by taking advantage of an in vitro differentiation assay based on the RNA-binding protein 6 over-expression, in which the procyclic forms differentiate into epimastigote forms but not into mammalian-infective metacyclic parasites. In total, morphology, immunofluorescence and cytometry analyses showed that the differentiation of the epimastigote stages into the metacyclic forms is abolished in the Δfbpase mutant."

To secrete them into the extracellular milieu, the parasites have at least two main specific membrane proteins, the pyruvate transporter and the aquaglyceroporins However, there are several other minor products from the glycolysis that must be excreted by the parasites and whose exit pathway until now remained elusive. As aquaglyceroporins from T. brucei (TbAQP1, 2, and 3) show a wide permeability profile for small solutes, we decided to evaluate if these proteins allow the passage of methylglyoxal, L-lactate, D-lactate and acetate molecules. We expressed heterologously TbAQP1, 2, and 3 in aquaglyceroporin-null yeast cells or in Xenopus laevis oocytes and demonstrated that these channels are permeable for methylglyoxal, L-lactate, D-lactate and acetate. We further demonstrate that methylglyoxal is highly toxic for bloodstream forms of T. brucei, while L-lactate and D-lactate appear almost harmless. Additionally, we discuss all our findings in the light of the novel metabolic discoveries, putting in context the participation of TbAQP1, 2, 3, and other proteins in the excretion of unwanted metabolic end-products."

Both the substrate and product of the reaction are key precursors for the synthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerol (TAG). We now show that expression of the Trypanosoma brucei lipin homolog TbLpn is essential for parasite survival in culture. Inducible down-regulation of TbLpn in T. brucei procyclic forms increased cellular PA content, decreased the numbers of lipid droplets, reduced TAG steady-state levels and inhibited in vivo ["
238,Glycerol kinase of African trypanosomes possesses an intrinsic phosphatase activity.,10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.07.028,2017-08-06,"['Enzyme mechanism', 'Glycerol kinase', 'Parasite metabolism', 'Phosphatase', 'Trypanosoma brucei', 'X-ray crystallography']","In general, glycerol kinases (GKs) are transferases that catalyze phospho group transfer from ATP to glycerol, and the mechanism was suggested to be random bi-bi. The reverse reaction i.e. phospho transfer from glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) to ADP is only physiologically feasible by the African trypanosome GK. In contrast to other GKs the mechanism of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense glycerol kinase (TbgGK) was shown to be in an ordered fashion, and proceeding via autophosphorylation. From the unique reaction mechanism of TbgGK, we envisaged its potential to possess phosphatase activity in addition to being a kinase.
Our hypothesis was tested by spectrophotometric and LC-MS/MS analyses using paranitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) and TbgGK's natural substrate, G3P respectively. Furthermore, protein X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis were performed to examine pNPP binding, catalytic residues, and the possible reaction mechanism.
In addition to its widely known and expected phosphotransferase (class II) activity, TbgGK can efficiently facilitate the hydrolytic cleavage of phosphoric anhydride bonds (a class III property). This phosphatase activity followed the classical Michaelis-Menten pattern and was competitively inhibited by ADP and G3P, suggesting a common catalytic site for both activities (phosphatase and kinase). The structure of the TGK-pNPP complex, and structure-guided mutagenesis implicated T276 to be important for the catalysis. Remarkably, we captured a crystallographic molecular snapshot of the phosphorylated T276 reaction intermediate.
We conclude that TbgGK has both kinase and phosphatase activities.
This is the first report on a bifunctional kinase/phosphatase enzyme among members of the sugar kinase family."

This work presents the characterization of the alternative, dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase TbDAT, which acylates primarily dihydroxyacetonephosphate and prefers palmitoyl-CoA as an acyl-CoA donor. TbDAT restores the viability of a yeast double null mutant that lacks glycerol-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase activities. A conditional null mutant of TbDAT in T. brucei procyclic form was created and characterized. TbDAT was important for survival during stationary phase and synthesis of ether lipids. In contrast, TbDAT was dispensable for normal growth. Our results show that in T. brucei procyclic forms i) TbDAT but not TbGAT is the physiologically relevant initial acyltransferase and ii) ether lipid precursors are primarily made by TbDAT."

For example, AQP2 in the human-infectious African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, is responsible for melarsoprol and pentamidine-uptake, and melarsoprol treatment-failure has been found to be due to AQP2-defects in these parasites. To further probe the roles of these transporters, we assembled a T. b. brucei strain lacking all three AQP-genes. Triple-null aqp1-2-3 T. b. brucei displayed only a very moderate growth defect in vitro, established infections in mice and recovered effectively from hypotonic-shock. The aqp1-2-3 trypanosomes did, however, display glycerol uptake and efflux defects. They failed to accumulate glycerol or to utilise glycerol as a carbon-source and displayed increased sensitivity to salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM), octyl gallate or propyl gallate; these inhibitors of trypanosome alternative oxidase (TAO) can increase intracellular glycerol to toxic levels. Notably, disruption of AQP2 alone generated cells with glycerol transport defects. Consistent with these findings, AQP2-defective, melarsoprol-resistant clinical isolates were sensitive to the TAO inhibitors, SHAM, propyl gallate and ascofuranone, relative to melarsoprol-sensitive reference strains. We conclude that African trypanosome AQPs are dispensable for viability and osmoregulation but they make important contributions to drug-uptake, glycerol-transport and respiratory-inhibitor sensitivity. We also discuss how the AQP-dependent inverse sensitivity to melarsoprol and respiratory inhibitors described here might be exploited."
242,In vivo cleavage specificity of Trypanosoma brucei editosome endonucleases.,10.1093/nar/gkx116,2017-03-24,[],"RNA editing is an essential post-transcriptional process that creates functional mitochondrial mRNAs in Kinetoplastids. Multiprotein editosomes catalyze pre-mRNA cleavage, uridine (U) insertion or deletion, and ligation as specified by guide RNAs. Three functionally and compositionally distinct editosomes differ by the mutually exclusive presence of the KREN1, KREN2 or KREN3 endonuclease and their associated partner proteins. Because endonuclease cleavage is a likely point of regulation for RNA editing, we elucidated endonuclease specificity in vivo. We used a mutant gamma ATP synthase allele (MGA) to circumvent the normal essentiality of the editing endonucleases, and created cell lines in which both alleles of one, two or all three of the endonucleases were deleted. Cells lacking multiple endonucleases had altered editosome sedimentation on glycerol gradients and substantial defects in overall editing. Deep sequencing analysis of RNAs from such cells revealed clear discrimination by editosomes between sites of deletion versus insertion editing and preferential but overlapping specificity for sites of insertion editing. Thus, endonuclease specificities in vivo are distinct but with some functional overlap. The overlapping specificities likely accommodate the more numerous sites of insertion versus deletion editing as editosomes collaborate to accurately edit thousands of distinct editing sites in vivo."

In the present study, trehalose was evaluated for its application in cryopreservation of both Trypanosoma brucei procyclic and bloodstream form cells. The cryopreservation efficiency was determined by the motility of trypanosomes after thawing, as well as a subsequent recovery and infectivity assessment. The viability of trypanosomes from cultivation that were frozen in a serial concentrations of trehalose showed similar results to classical CPAs of glycerol and DMSO. Nevertheless, trypanosomes cryopreserved in 0.2M trehalose showed the best growth characteristic during subsequent cultivation. In addition, CPA cocktails with trehalose and permeating CPA glycerol or DMSO were developed and evaluated. Interestingly, trypanosomes in host (mouse) blood cryopreserved in 0.4M trehalose plus 5% glycerol showed higher infectivity than those preserved in trehalose/DMSO cocktails as well as individually. Further investigations showed that, in comparison with slow freezing at -80°C, flash freezing in liquid nitrogen provided better cryopreservation for bloodstream form cells than slow freezing. In conclusion, trehalose is an easy, safe and efficient CPA for cryopreservation of T. brucei and potentially for other protozoan species and cells."

The present work reports the characterization of the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase TbGAT that initiates the biosynthesis of ester glycerolipids. TbGAT restored glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity when expressed in a Leishmania major deletion strain lacking this activity and exhibited preference for medium length, unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs. TbGAT localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane with its N-terminal domain facing the cytosol. Despite that a TbGAT null mutant in T. brucei procyclic forms lacked glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity, it remained viable and exhibited similar growth rate as the wild type. TbGAT was dispensable for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and GPI-anchored protein procyclin. However, the null mutant exhibited a slight decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis that was compensated with a modest increase in production of ether phosphatidylcholine. Our data suggest that an alternative initial acyltransferase takes over TbGAT's function in its absence."

One of the classic and most widely used drugs is pentamidine, an aromatic diamidine compound introduced in the 1940s. Recently, a genome-wide loss-of-function screen and a subsequently generated trypanosome knockout strain revealed a specific aquaglyceroporin, TbAQP2, to be required for high-affinity uptake of pentamidine. Yet, the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Here, we show that TbAQP2 is not a direct transporter for the di-basic, positively charged pentamidine. Even though one of the two common cation filters of aquaglyceroporins, i.e. the aromatic/arginine selectivity filter, is unconventional in TbAQP2, positively charged compounds are still excluded from passing the channel. We found, instead, that the unique selectivity filter layout renders pentamidine a nanomolar inhibitor of TbAQP2 glycerol permeability. Full, non-covalent inhibition of an aqua(glycero)porin in the nanomolar range has not been achieved before. The remarkable affinity derives from an electrostatic interaction with Asp265 and shielding from water as shown by structure-function evaluation and point mutation of Asp265. Exchange of the preceding Leu264 to arginine abolished pentamidine-binding and parasites expressing this mutant were pentamidine-resistant. Our results indicate that TbAQP2 is a high-affinity receptor for pentamidine. Taken together with localization of TbAQP2 in the flagellar pocket of bloodstream trypanosomes, we propose that pentamidine uptake is by endocytosis."

Glucose enters many branches of metabolism beyond glycolysis, which has been widely held to be the sole route of glucose metabolism. Whilst pyruvate is the major end-product of glucose catabolism, its transamination product, alanine, is also produced in significant quantities. The oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway is operative, although the non-oxidative branch is not. Ribose 5-phosphate generated through this pathway distributes widely into nucleotide synthesis and other branches of metabolism. Acetate, derived from glucose, is found associated with a range of acetylated amino acids and, to a lesser extent, fatty acids; while labelled glycerol is found in many glycerophospholipids. Glucose also enters inositol and several sugar nucleotides that serve as precursors to macromolecule biosynthesis. Although a Krebs cycle is not operative, malate, fumarate and succinate, primarily labelled in three carbons, were present, indicating an origin from phosphoenolpyruvate via oxaloacetate. Interestingly, the enzyme responsible for conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, was shown to be essential to the bloodstream form trypanosomes, as demonstrated by the lethal phenotype induced by RNAi-mediated downregulation of its expression. In addition, glucose derivatives enter pyrimidine biosynthesis via oxaloacetate as a precursor to aspartate and orotate."

They are potential vehicles or targets for chemotherapy, e.g. in Trypanosoma brucei melarsoprol and pentamidine uptake is facilitated by TbAQP-2. Transcriptome data suggests that there are at least three active aquaporins in the human liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, OvAQP-1, 2 and 3, and crude RNA silencing of OvAQP-1 and 2 has recently been shown to affect parasite swelling in destilled water. In the present work we demonstrate that OvAQP-3 is a major water-conducting channel of the parasite, that it can be detected from the newly excysted juvenile to the adult stage and that it is present in major tissues of the parasite. Furthermore, a comparative functional characterization of the three parasite AQPs was performed by using Xenopus oocyte swelling and yeast phenotypic assays. OvAQP-1, OvAQP-2, and OvAQP-3 were found to conduct water and glycerol while only the latter two were also able to conduct urea. In addition, all OvAQPs were found to transport ammonia and methylamine. Our findings demonstrate that the sequence-based classification into orthodox aquaporins and glycerol-conducting aquaglyceroporins is not functionally conserved in the parasite and implicate a broder range of functions for these channels."
249,Molecular basis for the reverse reaction of African human trypanosomes glycerol kinase.,10.1111/mmi.12831,2014-10-16,[],"The glycerol kinase (GK) of African human trypanosomes is compartmentalized in their glycosomes. Unlike the host GK, which under physiological conditions catalyzes only the forward reaction (ATP-dependent glycerol phosphorylation), trypanosome GK can additionally catalyze the reverse reaction. In fact, owing to this unique reverse catalysis, GK is potentially essential for the parasites survival in the human host, hence a promising drug target. The mechanism of its reverse catalysis was unknown; therefore, it was not clear if this ability was purely due to its localization in the organelles or whether structure-based catalytic differences also contribute. To investigate this lack of information, the X-ray crystal structure of this protein was determined up to 1.90 Å resolution, in its unligated form and in complex with three natural ligands. These data, in conjunction with results from structure-guided mutagenesis suggests that the trypanosome GK is possibly a transiently autophosphorylating threonine kinase, with the catalytic site formed by non-conserved residues. Our results provide a series of structural peculiarities of this enzyme, and gives unexpected insight into the reverse catalysis mechanism. Together, they provide an encouraging molecular framework for the development of trypanosome GK-specific inhibitors, which may lead to the design of new and safer trypanocidal drug(s)."

Moreover, we measured the activity of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the overall oxygen consumption and the mitochondrial membrane potential in each species. The comparative analysis suggests an inverse relationship between the activities of respiratory complexes I and II, as well as the overall activity of the canonical complexes and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

The D-myo-inositol in the physiological substrate was successfully replaced by cyclohexanediol and is still a substrate for T. brucei GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase. However, this compound became sensitive to the stereochemistry of the glycoside linkage (the β-anomer was neither substrate or inhibitor) and the structure of the lipid moiety (the hexadecyl derivatives were inhibitors). Chemistry was successfully developed to replace the phosphate with a sulphonamide, but the compound was neither a substrate or an inhibitor, confirming the importance of the phosphate for molecular recognition. We also replaced the glucosamine by an acyclic analogue, but this also was inactive, both as a substrate and inhibitor. These findings add significantly to our understanding of substrate and inhibitor binding to the GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase enzyme and will have a bearing on the design of future inhibitors."

The ablation of TbSPPS gene expression by RNA interference increased the generation of reactive oxygen species and reduced cell growth and oxygen consumption. The addition of glycerol to the culture medium exacerbated the phenotype by blocking its endogenous generation and excretion. The participation of TbSPPS in UQ synthesis was further confirmed by growth rescue using UQ with 10 isoprenyl subunits (UQ10). Furthermore, the survival of infected mice was prolonged upon the downregulation of TbSPPS and/or the addition of glycerol to drinking water. TbSPPS is inhibited by 1-[(n-oct-1-ylamino)ethyl] 1,1-bisphosphonic acid, and treatment with this compound was lethal for the cells. The findings that both UQ9 and ATP pools were severely depleted by the drug and that exogenous UQ10 was able to fully rescue growth of the inhibited parasites strongly suggest that TbSPPS and UQ synthesis are the main targets of the drug. These two strategies highlight the importance of TbSPPS for T. brucei, justifying further efforts to validate it as a new drug target."

Trypanosoma brucei possesses two FAD-dependent G3PDHs.

In this work, we used RNA interference and protein overexpression and tagging to shed light on the relative contributions of both FAD-G3PDHs to overall cellular metabolism. Our results indicate that mtG3PDH is essential for the bloodstream stage of T. brucei, while in the procyclic stage the enzyme is dispensable.

GPEET and EP procyclins constitute the parasite's surface coat at this stage of the life cycle, and the presence or absence of GPEET distinguishes between early and late procyclic forms, respectively. Differentiation from early to late procyclic forms in vivo occurs in the fly midgut and can be mimicked in culture. Our analysis of this transition in vitro delivered new insights into the process of GPEET repression. First, we could show that parasites followed a concrete sequence of events upon triggering differentiation: after undergoing an initial growth arrest, cells lost GPEET protein, and finally late procyclic forms resumed proliferation. Second, we determined the stability of both GPEET and EP mRNA during differentiation. GPEET mRNA is exceptionally stable in early procyclic forms, with a half-life >6h. The GPEET mRNA detected in late procyclic form cultures is a mixture of transcripts from both bona fide late procyclic forms and GPEET-positive 'laggard' parasites present in these cultures. However, its stability was clearly reduced during differentiation and in late procyclic form cultures. Alternatively processed GPEET transcripts were enriched in samples from late procyclic forms, suggesting that altered mRNA processing might contribute to repression of GPEET in this developmental stage. In addition, we detected GPEET transcripts with non-templated oligo(U) tails that were enriched in late procyclic forms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting a uridylyl-tailed, nuclear-encoded mRNA species in trypanosomatids or any other protozoa."

258,Nucleolar proteins regulate stage-specific gene expression and ribosomal RNA maturation in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1111/mmi.12227,2013-04-27,[],"Different life-cycle stages of Trypanosoma brucei are characterized by stage-specific glycoprotein coats. GPEET procyclin, the major surface protein of early procyclic (insect midgut) forms, is transcribed in the nucleolus by RNA polymerase I as part of a polycistronic precursor that is processed to monocistronic mRNAs. In culture, when differentiation to late procyclic forms is triggered by removal of glycerol, the precursor is still transcribed, but accumulation of GPEET mRNA is prevented by a glycerol-responsive element in the 3' UTR. A genome-wide RNAi screen for persistent expression of GPEET in glycerol-free medium identified a novel protein, NRG1 (Nucleolar Regulator of GPEET 1), as a negative regulator. NRG1 associates with GPEET mRNA and with several nucleolar proteins. These include two PUF proteins, TbPUF7 and TbPUF10, and BOP1, a protein required for rRNA processing in other organisms. RNAi against each of these components prolonged or even increased GPEET expression in the absence of glycerol as well as causing a significant reduction in 5.8S rRNA and its immediate precursor. These results indicate that components of a complex used for rRNA maturation can have an additional role in regulating mRNAs that originate in the nucleolus."

The lead of this series (B6, 2-phenoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) showed an ED(50) of 80 nM against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, and a selectivity index of 74 with respect to mammalian cells. A multitarget profile for this compound is easily conceivable, because quinones, as natural products, serve plants as potent defense chemicals with an intrinsic multifunctional mechanism of action. To disclose such a multitarget profile of B6, we exploited a chemical proteomics approach.
A functionalized congener of B6 was immobilized on a solid matrix and used to isolate target proteins from Trypanosoma brucei lysates. Mass analysis delivered two enzymes, i.e. glycosomal glycerol kinase and glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, as potential molecular targets for B6. Both enzymes were recombinantly expressed and purified, and used for chemical validation. Indeed, B6 was able to inhibit both enzymes with IC(50) values in the micromolar range. The multifunctional profile was further characterized in experiments using permeabilized Trypanosoma brucei cells and mitochondrial cell fractions. It turned out that B6 was also able to generate oxygen radicals, a mechanism that may additionally contribute to its observed potent trypanocidal activity.
Overall, B6 showed a multitarget mechanism of action, which provides a molecular explanation of its promising anti-trypanosomatid activity. Furthermore, the forward chemical genetics approach here applied may be viable in the molecular characterization of novel multitarget ligands."

In Trypanosoma brucei, the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the mitochondrial phospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), have not been studied experimentally. We now report the characterization of T. brucei phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase (TbPgps), the rate-limiting enzyme in PG formation, which was identified based on its homology to other eukaryotic Pgps. Lipid quantification and metabolic labelling experiments show that TbPgps gene knock-down results in loss of PG and a reduction of another mitochondria-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin. Using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting of digitonin-isolated mitochondria, we show that TbPgps localizes to the mitochondrion. Moreover, reduced TbPgps expression in T. brucei procyclic forms leads to alterations in mitochondrial morphology, reduction in the amounts of respiratory complexes III and IV and, ultimately, parasite death. Using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis we demonstrate for the first time in a eukaryotic organism that TbPgps is a component of a 720 kDa protein complex, co-migrating with T. brucei cardiolipin synthase and cytochrome c1, a protein of respiratory complex III."
261,Alternative NADH dehydrogenase (NDH2): intermembrane-space-facing counterpart of mitochondrial complex I in the procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1017/S003118201200162X,2012-11-01,[],"The respiratory chain of the procyclic stage of Trypanosoma brucei contains the standard complexes I through IV, as well as several alternative enzymes contributing to electron flow. In this work, we studied the function of an alternative NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDH2). Depletion of target mRNA was achieved using RNA interference (RNAi). In the non-induced and RNAi-induced cell growth, membrane potential change, alteration in production of reactive oxygen species, overall respiration, enzymatic activities of complexes I, III and/or IV and distribution of NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductase activities in glycerol gradient fractions were measured. Finally, respiration using different substrates was tested on digitonin-permeabilized cells. The induced RNAi cell line exhibited slower growth, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and lower sensitivity of respiration to inhibitors. Mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was the only enzymatic activity that has significantly changed in the interfered cells. This elevation as well as a decrease of respiration using NADH was confirmed on digitonin-permeabilized cells. The data presented here together with previously published findings on complex I led us to propose that NDH2 is the major NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductase responsible for cytosolic and not for mitochondrial NAD+ regeneration in the mitochondrion of procyclic T. brucei."
262,Dynamic modelling under uncertainty: the case of Trypanosoma brucei energy metabolism.,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002352,2012-03-02,[],"Kinetic models of metabolism require detailed knowledge of kinetic parameters. However, due to measurement errors or lack of data this knowledge is often uncertain. The model of glycolysis in the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei is a particularly well analysed example of a quantitative metabolic model, but so far it has been studied with a fixed set of parameters only. Here we evaluate the effect of parameter uncertainty. In order to define probability distributions for each parameter, information about the experimental sources and confidence intervals for all parameters were collected. We created a wiki-based website dedicated to the detailed documentation of this information: the SilicoTryp wiki (http://silicotryp.ibls.gla.ac.uk/wiki/Glycolysis). Using information collected in the wiki, we then assigned probability distributions to all parameters of the model. This allowed us to sample sets of alternative models, accurately representing our degree of uncertainty. Some properties of the model, such as the repartition of the glycolytic flux between the glycerol and pyruvate producing branches, are robust to these uncertainties. However, our analysis also allowed us to identify fragilities of the model leading to the accumulation of 3-phosphoglycerate and/or pyruvate. The analysis of the control coefficients revealed the importance of taking into account the uncertainties about the parameters, as the ranking of the reactions can be greatly affected. This work will now form the basis for a comprehensive Bayesian analysis and extension of the model considering alternative topologies."
264,Alba-domain proteins of Trypanosoma brucei are cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins that interact with the translation machinery.,10.1371/journal.pone.0022463,2011-08-04,[],"Trypanosoma brucei and related pathogens transcribe most genes as polycistronic arrays that are subsequently processed into monocistronic mRNAs. Expression is frequently regulated post-transcriptionally by cis-acting elements in the untranslated regions (UTRs). GPEET and EP procyclins are the major surface proteins of procyclic (insect midgut) forms of T. brucei. Three regulatory elements common to the 3' UTRs of both mRNAs regulate mRNA turnover and translation. The glycerol-responsive element (GRE) is unique to the GPEET 3' UTR and regulates its expression independently from EP. A synthetic RNA encompassing the GRE showed robust sequence-specific interactions with cytoplasmic proteins in electromobility shift assays. This, combined with column chromatography, led to the identification of 3 Alba-domain proteins. RNAi against Alba3 caused a growth phenotype and reduced the levels of Alba1 and Alba2 proteins, indicative of interactions between family members. Tandem-affinity purification and co-immunoprecipitation verified these interactions and also identified Alba4 in sub-stoichiometric amounts. Alba proteins are cytoplasmic and are recruited to starvation granules together with poly(A) RNA. Concomitant depletion of all four Alba proteins by RNAi specifically reduced translation of a reporter transcript flanked by the GPEET 3' UTR. Pulldown of tagged Alba proteins confirmed interactions with poly(A) binding proteins, ribosomal protein P0 and, in the case of Alba3, the cap-binding protein eIF4E4. In addition, Alba2 and Alba3 partially cosediment with polyribosomes in sucrose gradients. Alba-domain proteins seem to have exhibited great functional plasticity in the course of evolution. First identified as DNA-binding proteins in Archaea, then in association with nuclear RNase MRP/P in yeast and mammalian cells, they were recently described as components of a translationally silent complex containing stage-regulated mRNAs in Plasmodium. Our results are also consistent with stage-specific regulation of translation in trypanosomes, but most likely in the context of initiation."
265,Functional characterization of three aquaglyceroporins from Trypanosoma brucei in osmoregulation and glycerol transport.,10.1159/000327968,2011-04-08,[],"Previous studies using bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei have shown that glycerol transport in this parasite occurs via specific membrane proteins, namely a glycerol transporter and glycerol channels [1]. Later, we cloned, expressed and characterized the transport properties of all three aquaglyceroporins (AQP1-3) [2], which were found permeable for water, glycerol and other small uncharged solutes like dihydroxyacetone [3]. Here, we report on the cellular localization of TbAQP1 and TbAQP3 in bloodstream form trypanosomes. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis showed that TbAQP1 is exclusively localized in the flagellar membrane, whereas TbAQP3 was found in the plasma membrane.In addition, we analyzed the functions of all 3 AQPs, using an inducible inheritable double-stranded RNA interference methodology. All AQP knockdown cell lines were still able to survive hypo-osmotic stress conditions, except AQP2 knockdown parasites. Depleted TbAQP2 negatively impacted cell growth and the regulatory volume recovery, whereas AQP1 und 3 knockdown trypanosomes displayed phenotypes consistent with their localization in external membranes. A simultaneous knockdown of all 3 AQPs showed that the cells were able to substitute the missing glycerol uptake capability through a putative glycerol transporter."
266,Differential kinetic activities of glycerol kinase among African trypanosome species: phylogenetic and therapeutic implications.,10.1292/jvms.10-0481,2010-12-29,[],"African trypanosome species are causative agents for sleeping sickness in humans and nagana disease in cattle. Trypanosoma brucei can generate ATP via a reverse reaction with glycerol kinase (GK) when alternative oxidase (AOX) is inhibited; thus, GK is considered to be a crucial target for chemotherapy combined with AOX. However, the energy metabolism systems of African trypanosome species other than T. brucei are poorly understood. Thus, GK genes were surveyed from genome databases and cloned by PCR from T. vivax and T. congolense. Then, recombinant GK proteins (rGK) of T. vivax, T. congolense and T. brucei were expressed and purified. Kinetic analysis of these rGK proteins revealed that the K(m) values of T. congolense rGK for ADP and G-3-P substrates were lower than those of T. vivax and T. brucei. The expression level of GK molecules was highest in T. congolense cells and lowest in T. vivax cells. Based on these results, effective combination dosages of ascofuranone, a specific inhibitor of AOX, and glycerol, an inhibitor of the GK reverse reaction, were determined by using in vitro-cultured trypanosome cells."
267,Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is active in but non-essential for procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2010.11.003,2010-11-16,[],"The requirement of complex I (NADH:ubiquionone oxidoreductase) for respiration in Trypanosoma brucei is controversial. Recent identification of homologues of its subunits in mitochondrial proteome resolved a question of its presence or absence. However, with one exception, no data have been available concerning the function(s) of complex I or its subunits. Here we present a functional RNAi study of three (NUBM, NUKM, NUEM) putative subunits of this complex. Although no changes were detected in growth, mitochondrial membrane potential or reactive oxygen species production in cell lines depleted for target transcript, the NUBM and NUKM RNAi knock-downs showed decreased specific NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity. Moreover, glycerol gradients of all cell lines revealed the presence of two distinct peaks of NADH dehydrogenase activity, with shifted sensitivity to inhibitors of complex I upon RNAi induction. Thus complex I is not only present in the procyclic stage of T. brucei 29-13 strain, but it does participate in electron transport chain."
269,Lipid remodelling of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) glycoconjugates in procyclic-form trypanosomes: biosynthesis and processing of GPIs revisited.,10.1042/BJ20100229,2010-03-30,[],"The African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, has been used as a model to study the biosynthesis of GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchors. In mammalian (bloodstream)-form parasites, diacyl-type GPI precursors are remodelled in their lipid moieties before attachment to variant surface glycoproteins. In contrast, the GPI precursors of insect (procyclic)-form parasites, consisting of lyso-(acyl)PI (inositol-acylated acyl-lyso-phosphatidylinositol) species, remain unaltered before protein attachment. By using a combination of metabolic labelling, cell-free assays and complementary MS analyses, we show in the present study that GPI-anchored glycoconjugates in T. congolense procyclic forms initially receive tri-acylated GPI precursors, which are subsequently de-acylated either at the glycerol backbone or on the inositol ring. Chemical and enzymatic treatments of [3H]myristate-labelled lipids in combination with ESI-MS/MS (electrospray ionization-tandem MS) and MALDI-QIT-TOF-MS3 (matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-quadrupole ion trap-time-of-flight MS) analyses indicate that the structure of the lipid moieties of steady-state GPI lipids from T. congolense procyclic forms consist of a mixture of lyso-(acyl)PI, diacyl-PI and diacyl-(acyl)PI species. Interestingly, some of these species are myristoylated at the sn-2 position. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of lipid remodelling at the level of protein- or polysaccharide-linked GPI anchors in procyclic-form trypanosomes."
270,A structural domain mediates attachment of ethanolamine phosphoglycerol to eukaryotic elongation factor 1A in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1371/journal.pone.0009486,2010-03-09,[],"Ethanolamine phosphoglycerol (EPG) represents a protein modification that so far has only been found in eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A). In mammals and plants, EPG is covalently attached to two conserved glutamate residues located in domains II and III of eEF1A. In contrast, Trypanosoma brucei eEF1A contains a single EPG attached to Glu362 in domain III. The sequence and/or structural requirements for covalent linkage of EPG to eEF1A have not been determined for any organism. Using a combination of biosynthetic labelling of parasites with tritiated ethanolamine and mass spectrometry analyses, we demonstrate that replacement of Glu362 in T. brucei eEF1A by site-directed mutagenesis prevents EPG attachment, whereas single or multiple amino acid substitutions around the attachment site are not critical. In addition, by expressing a series of eEF1A deletion mutants in T. brucei procyclic forms, we demonstrate that a peptide consisting of 80 amino acids of domain III of eEF1A is sufficient for EPG attachment to occur. Furthermore, EPG addition also occurs if domain III of eEF1A is fused to a soluble reporter protein. To our knowledge, this is the first report addressing amino acid sequence, or structure, requirements for EPG modification of eEF1A in any organism. Using T. brucei as a model organism, we show that amino acid substitutions around the modification site are not critical for EPG attachment and that a truncated version of domain III of eEF1A is sufficient to mediate EPG addition."

In this study, a recombinant Trypanosoma brucei gambiense GK (rTbgGK) with an N-terminal cleavable His(6) tag was overexpressed, purified to homogeneity and crystallized by the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method using PEG 400 as a precipitant. A complete X-ray diffraction data set to 2.75 A resolution indicated that the crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 63.84, b = 121.50, c = 154.59 A. The presence of two rTbgGK molecules in the asymmetric unit gives a Matthews coefficient (V(M)) of 2.5 A(3) Da(-1), corresponding to 50% solvent content."
272,A protein-protein interaction map of trypanosome ~20S editosomes.,10.1074/jbc.M109.059378,2009-12-19,[],"Mitochondrial mRNA editing in trypanosomatid parasites involves several multiprotein assemblies, including three very similar complexes that contain the key enzymatic editing activities and sediment at ~20S on glycerol gradients. These ~20S editosomes have a common set of 12 proteins, including enzymes for uridylyl (U) removal and addition, 2 RNA ligases, 2 proteins with RNase III-like domains, and 6 proteins with predicted oligonucleotide binding (OB) folds. In addition, each of the 3 distinct ~20S editosomes contains a different RNase III-type endonuclease, 1 of 3 related proteins and, in one case, an additional exonuclease. Here we present a protein-protein interaction map that was obtained through a combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis and subcomplex reconstitution with recombinant protein. This map interlinks ten of the proteins and in several cases localizes the protein region mediating the interaction, which often includes the predicted OB-fold domain. The results indicate that the OB-fold proteins form an extensive protein-protein interaction network that connects the two trimeric subcomplexes that catalyze U removal or addition and RNA ligation. One of these proteins, KREPA6, interacts with the OB-fold zinc finger protein in each subcomplex that interconnects their two catalytic proteins. Another OB-fold protein, KREPA3, appears to link to the putative endonuclease subcomplex. These results reveal a physical organization that underlies the coordination of the various catalytic and substrate binding activities within the ~20S editosomes during the editing process."
273,Evidence for a degradosome-like complex in the mitochondria of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/j.febslet.2009.06.024,2009-06-23,[],"Mitochondrial RNA turnover in yeast involves the degradosome, composed of DSS-1 exoribonuclease and SUV3 RNA helicase. Here, we describe a degradosome-like complex, containing SUV3 and DSS-1 homologues, in the early branching protozoan, Trypanosoma brucei. TbSUV3 is mitochondrially localized and co-sediments with TbDSS-1 on glycerol gradients. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrates that TbSUV3 and TbDSS-1 associate in a stable complex, which differs from the yeast degradosome in that it is not stably associated with mitochondrial ribosomes. This is the first report of a mitochondrial degradosome-like complex outside of yeast. Our data indicate an early evolutionary origin for the mitochondrial SUV3/DSS-1 containing complex."
274,Uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing in trypanosomatid mitochondria: In search of the editosome.,10.1261/rna.1642809,2009-05-19,[],"The RNA ligase-containing or L-complex is the core complex involved in uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing in trypanosome mitochondria. Blue native gels of glycerol gradient-separated fractions of mitochondrial lysate from cells transfected with the TAP-tagged editing protein, LC-8 (TbMP44/KREPB5), show a approximately 1 MDa L-complex band and, in addition, two minor higher molecular weight REL1-containing complexes: one (L*a) co-sedimenting with the L-complex and running in the gel at around 1.2 MDa; the other (L*b) showing a continuous increase in molecular weight from 1 MDa to particles sedimenting over 70S. The L*b-complexes appear to be mainly composed of L-complex components, since polypeptide profiles of L- and L*b-complex gradient fractions were similar in composition and L*b-complex bands often degraded to L-complex bands after manipulation or freeze-thaw cycles. The L*a-complex may be artifactual since this gel shift can be produced by various experimental manipulations. However, the nature of the change and any cellular role remain to be determined. The L*b-complexes from both lysate and TAP pull-down were sensitive to RNase A digestion, suggesting that RNA is involved with the stability of the L*b-complexes. The MRP1/2 RNA binding complex is localized mainly in the L*b-complexes in substoichiometric amounts and this association is RNase sensitive. We suggest that the L*b-complexes may provide a scaffold for dynamic interaction with other editing factors during the editing process to form the active holoenzyme or ""editosome."""
276,Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C regulates transferrin endocytosis in the African trypanosome.,10.1042/BJ20080167,2008-09-13,[],"GPI-PLC (glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C) is expressed in bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei, a protozoan that causes human African trypanosomiasis. Loss of genes encoding GPI-PLC reduces the virulence of a pleomorphic strain of the parasite, for reasons that are not clear. In the present paper, we report that GPI-PLC stimulates endocytosis of transferrin by 300-500%. Surprisingly, GPI-PLC is not detected at endosomes, suggesting that the enzyme does not interact directly with the endosomal machinery. We therefore hypothesized that a diffusible product of the GPI-PLC enzyme reaction [possibly DAG (diacylglycerol)] mediated the biological effects of the protein. Two sets of data support this assertion. First, a catalytically inactive Q81L mutant of GPI-PLC, expressed in a GPI-PLC-null background, had no effect on endocytosis, indicating that enzyme activity is essential for the protein to stimulate endocytosis. Secondly, the exogenous DAGs OAG (1-oleyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol) and DMG (dimyristoylglycerol) independently stimulated endocytosis of transferrin. Furthermore, the DAG mimic PMA, a phorbol ester, also activated endocytosis in T. brucei. DAG-stimulated endocytosis is a novel pathway in the trypanosome. We surmise that (i) GPI-PLC regulates transferrin endocytosis in T. brucei, (ii) GPI-PLC is a signalling enzyme, and (iii) DAG is a second messenger for GPI-PLC. We propose that regulation of endocytosis is a physiological function of GPI-PLC in bloodstream T. brucei."
277,The mitochondrion is a site of trypanocidal action of the aromatic diamidine DB75 in bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1128/AAC.00642-07,2007-12-19,[],"Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a fatal tropical disease caused by infection with protozoans of the species Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense. An oral prodrug, DB289, is a promising new therapy undergoing phase III clinical trials for early-stage HAT. DB289 is metabolically converted to the active trypanocidal diamidine DB75 [2,5-bis(4-amidinophenyl)furan]. We previously determined that DB75 inhibits yeast mitochondrial function (C. A. Lanteri, B. L. Trumpower, R. R. Tidwell, and S. R. Meshnick, Antimicrob. Agent Chemother. 48:3968-3974, 2004). The purpose of this study was to investigate if DB75 targets the mitochondrion of T. b. brucei bloodstream forms. DB75 rapidly accumulates within the mitochondria of living trypanosomes, as indicated by the fluorescent colocalization of DB75 with a mitochondrion-specific dye. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of rhodamine 123-stained living trypanosomes shows that DB75 and other trypanocidal diamidines (pentamidine and diminazene) collapse the mitochondrial membrane potential. DB75 inhibits ATP hydrolysis within T. brucei mitochondria and appears to inhibit the oligomycin-sensitive F 1 F 0-ATPase and perhaps other ATPases. DB75 is most likely not an inhibitor of electron transport within trypanosome mitochondria, since DB75 fails to inhibit mitochondrial respiration when glycerol-3-phosphate is used as the respiratory substrate. However, DB75 inhibits whole-cell respiration (50% inhibitory concentration, 20 microM) at drug concentrations and incubation durations that also result in the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, these findings suggest that the mitochondrion is a target of the trypanocidal action of DB75."
278,The Gup1 homologue of Trypanosoma brucei is a GPI glycosylphosphatidylinositol remodelase.,10.1111/j.1365-2958.2007.06043.x,2007-11-27,[],"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipids of Trypanosoma brucei undergo lipid remodelling, whereby longer fatty acids on the glycerol are replaced by myristate (C14:0). A similar process occurs on GPI proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae where Per1p first deacylates, Gup1p subsequently reacylates the anchor lipid, thus replacing a shorter fatty acid by C26:0. Heterologous expression of the GUP1 homologue of T. brucei in gup1Delta yeast cells partially normalizes the gup1Delta phenotype and restores the transfer of labelled fatty acids from Coenzyme A to lyso-GPI proteins in a newly developed microsomal assay. In this assay, the Gup1p from T. brucei (tbGup1p) strongly prefers C14:0 and C12:0 over C16:0 and C18:0, whereas yeast Gup1p strongly prefers C16:0 and C18:0. This acyl specificity of tbGup1p closely matches the reported specificity of the reacylation of free lyso-GPI lipids in microsomes of T. brucei. Depletion of tbGup1p in trypanosomes by RNAi drastically reduces the rate of myristate incorporation into the sn-2 position of lyso-GPI lipids. Thus, tbGup1p is involved in the addition of myristate to sn-2 during GPI remodelling in T. brucei and can account for the fatty acid specificity of this process. tbGup1p can act on GPI proteins as well as on GPI lipids."
279,Trypanosoma congolense procyclins: unmasking cryptic major surface glycoproteins in procyclic forms.,10.1128/EC.00067-06,2006-08-10,[],"In the tsetse fly, the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma congolense is covered by a dense layer of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecules. These include a protease-resistant surface molecule (PRS), which is expressed by procyclic forms early in infection, and a glutamic acid- and alanine-rich protein (GARP), which appears at later stages. Since neither of these surface antigens is expressed at intermediate stages, we investigated whether a GPI-anchored protein of 50 to 58 kDa, previously detected in procyclic culture forms, might constitute the coat of these parasites. We therefore partially purified the protein from T. congolense Kilifi procyclic forms, obtained an N-terminal amino acid sequence, and identified its gene. Detailed analyses showed that the mature protein consists almost exclusively of 13 heptapeptide repeats (EPGENGT). The protein is densely N glycosylated, with up to 13 high-mannose oligosaccharides ranging from Man(5)GlcNAc(2) to Man(9)GlcNAc(2) linked to the peptide repeats. The lipid moiety of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol is composed of sn-1-stearoyl-2-lyso-glycerol-3-HPO(4)-1-(2-O-acyl)-d-myo-inositol. Heavily glycosylated proteins with similar repeats were subsequently identified in T. congolense Savannah procyclic forms. Collectively, this group of proteins was named T. congolense procyclins to reflect their relationship to the EP and GPEET procyclins of T. brucei. Using an antiserum raised against the EPGENGT repeat, we show that T. congolense procyclins are expressed continuously in the fly midgut and thus form the surface coat of cells that are negative for both PRS and GARP."
280,Preferential interaction of a 25kDa protein with an A6 pre-mRNA substrate for RNA editing in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/j.ijpara.2006.05.011,2006-07-25,[],"Mitochondrial gene expression in kinetoplastids is controlled after transcription, potentially at the levels of RNA maturation, stability and translation. Among these processes, RNA editing by U-insertion/deletion catalysed by multi-subunit editing complexes is best characterised at the molecular level. Nevertheless, mitochondrial RNA metabolism overall remains poorly understood, including the potential regulatory factors that may interact with the relevant catalytic molecular machines and/or RNA substrates. Here we report on a approximately 25kDa polypeptide in mitochondrial extracts that exhibits a preferential ""zero-distance"" photo-crosslinking interaction with an A6 pre-mRNA model substrate for RNA editing containing a single [(32)P] at the first editing site. The approximately 25kDa polypeptide purified away from editosomes upon ion-exchange chromatography and glycerol gradient sedimentation. Competition assays with homologous and heterologous transcripts suggest that the preferential recognition of the A6 substrate is based on relatively low-specificity RNA-protein contacts. Our mapping and substrate truncation analyses suggest that the crosslinking activity primarily targeted a predicted stem-loop region containing the first editing sites. Consistent with the notion that pre-mRNA folding may be required, pre-annealing with guide RNA abolished crosslinking. Interestingly, this preferential protein interaction with the A6 substrate seemed to require adenosine 5'-triphosphate but not hydrolysis. As in other biological systems, fine regulation in vivo may be brought about by transient networks of relatively low-specificity interactions in which multiple auxiliary factors bind to mRNAs and/or editing complexes in unique higher-order assemblies."
281,The mitochondrial FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Trypanosomatidae and the glycosomal redox balance of insect stages of Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania spp.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2006.05.006,2006-06-30,[],"The genes for the mitochondrial FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were identified in Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major genomes. We have expressed the L. major gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and confirmed the subcellular localization and activity of the produced enzyme. Using cultured T. brucei procyclic and Leishmania mexicana promastigote cells with a permeabilized plasma membrane and containing intact glycosomes, it was shown that dihydroxyacetone phosphate is converted into pyruvate, and stimulates oxygen consumption, indicating that all components of the glycerol 3-phosphate/dihydoxyacetone phosphate shuttle between glycosomes and mitochondrion are present in these insect stages of both organisms. A computer model has been prepared for the energy and carbohydrate metabolism of these cells. It was used in an elementary mode analysis to get insight into the metabolic role of the shuttle in these insect-stage parasites. Our analysis suggests that the shuttle fulfils important roles for these organisms, albeit different from its well-known function in the T. brucei bloodstream form. It allows (1) a high yield of further metabolizable glycolytic products by decreasing the need to produce a secreted end product of glycosomal metabolism, succinate; (2) the consumption of glycerol and glycerol 3-phosphate derived from lipids; and (3) to keep the redox balance of the glycosome finely tuned due to a highly flexible and redundant system."
282,Cryopreservation of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense in a commercial cryomedium developed for bull semen.,10.1016/j.actatropica.2005.11.011,2006-06-30,[],"There have been major advances in the formulation of cryomedia for spermatozoa owing to their economic importance. In this study, the suitability of the commercial cryomedium Triladyl developed for bull semen was evaluated for the cryopreservation of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Cryopreservation efficacy was determined by direct counting of motile trypanosomes and by viability assessment using in vitro and in vivo methods. Culture medium containing 10% glycerol was used as the control. Trypanosomes cryopreserved in Triladyl demonstrated a higher in vitro viability than those in culture medium with 10% glycerol. Similar results were obtained in vivo in immunosuppressed Mastomys natalensis. Trypanosomes cryopreserved in Triladyl showed better growth characteristics than those in culture medium with glycerol. It can be concluded that the use of Triladyl in the cryopreservation of T. b. gambiense leads to a better survival of the trypanosomes which could lead to an improved isolation of T. b. gambiense from sleeping sickness patients."
283,In silico prediction of the glycosomal enzymes of Leishmania major and trypanosomes.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2006.02.010,2006-03-21,[],"In total, 37080 protein sequences of the three trypanosomatids Leishmania major, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi, were used to predict the trypanosomatid glycosomal proteome. All protein sequences were analyzed for the presence of either a C-terminal (PTS1) or an N-terminal (PTS2) peroxisomal targeting sequence. For L. major 191 potential PTS1-containing proteins and 68 potential PTS2-containing proteins with homologues in T. brucei and T. cruzi were identified. About 50% of them were hypothetical proteins to which no function was attributed. From those proteins with known function it appears that the predicted glycosomal proteome of L. major strongly resembles that of T. brucei and T. cruzi with respect to enzyme content. Glycosomes are not only involved in glycolysis, but are predicted to carry out also gluconeogenesis, reactions of the hexose-monophosphate pathway, purine salvage and pyrimidine biosynthesis, beta-oxidation of fatty acids, fatty acid elongation and the biosynthesis of ether lipids. In addition, they seem to catalyze several reactions of isoprenoid synthesis and are involved in oxidant stress protection."
284,Chemotherapeutic efficacy of ascofuranone in Trypanosoma vivax-infected mice without glycerol.,10.1016/j.parint.2005.09.003,2005-11-18,[],"Ascofuranone, an antibiotic isolated from Ascochyta visiae, showed trypanocidal activity in Trypanosoma vivax-infected mice. A single dose of 50 mg/kg ascofuranone effectively cured the mice without the help of glycerol. Repeated administrations of this drug further enhanced its chemotherapeutic effect. After two, three, and four consecutive days treatment, the doses needed to cure the infection decreased to 25, 12, and 6 mg/kg, so that the total doses administered were 50, 36 and 24 mg/kg, respectively. Ascofuranone (50 mg/kg) also had a prophylactic effect against T. vivax infection within the first two days after administration. This prophylactic activity diminished to 80% by day 3 and completely disappeared four days after administration. Of particular interest in this study was that ascofuranone had trypanocidal activity in T. vivax-infected mice in the absence of glycerol, whereas co-administration of glycerol or repeated administrations of this drug are needed for Trypanosoma brucei brucei infection. Our present results strongly suggest that ascofuranone is also an effective tool in chemotherapy against African trypanosomiasis in domestic animals."
288,RNA interference analyses suggest a transcript-specific regulatory role for mitochondrial RNA-binding proteins MRP1 and MRP2 in RNA editing and other RNA processing in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.M405933200,2004-10-27,[],"Mitochondrial RNA-binding proteins MRP1 and MRP2 occur in a heteromeric complex that appears to play a role in U-insertion/deletion editing in trypanosomes. Reduction in the levels of MRP1 (gBP21) and/or MRP2 (gBP25) mRNA by RNA interference in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei resulted in severe growth inhibition. It also resulted in the loss of both proteins, even when only one of the MRP mRNAs was reduced, indicating a mutual dependence for stability. Elimination of the MRPs gave rise to substantially reduced levels of edited CyB and RPS12 mRNAs but little or no reduction of the level of edited Cox2, Cox3, and A6 mRNAs as measured by poisoned primer extension analyses. In contrast, edited NADH-dehydrogenase (ND) subunit 7 mRNA was increased 5-fold in MRP1+2 double knock-down cells. Furthermore, MRP elimination resulted in reduced levels of Cox1, ND4, and ND5 mRNAs, which are never edited, whereas mitoribosomal 12 S rRNA levels were not affected. These data indicate that MRP1 and MRP2 are not essential for RNA editing per se but, rather, play a regulatory role in the editing of specific transcripts and other RNA processing activities."
289,Arsenolipids.,10.1016/j.plipres.2004.07.001,2004-10-02,[],"Natural arsenolipids are analogues of neutral lipids, like monoglycerides, glycolipids, phospho- and also phosphonolipids. They have been found in microorganisms, fungi, plants, lichens, in marine mollusks, sponges, other invertebrates, and in fish tissues. This review presented structures of natural arsenolipids (and derivatives), their distribution, biogenesis in algae and invertebrates, synthesis, and also biological activity. Arsenolipids are thought to be end products of arsenate detoxification processes, involving reduction and oxidative methylation and adenosylation. The proposed biogenesis of arsenolipids is based on the natural occurrence of arsenic metabolites, and all the intermediates in the proposed pathway have been identified as natural products of algal origin. Different arseno species are shown to be inhibitors of glycerol kinase, bovine carbonic anhydrase, and also is an effective therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia, and there has been promising activity noted in other hematologic and solid tumors. Arsonoliposomes demonstrated high anti-trypanosomal activity against Trypanosoma brucei and inhibit growth of some types of cancer cells (HL-60,C6 and GH3)."
292,Simulated complex dynamics of glycolysis in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.02.007,2004-06-05,[],"Glycolysis in Trypanosoma brucei was modeled using a reaction transport simulator and tested for possible complex dynamics. The glycolytic model is multi-compartmentalized and accounts for the exchange of metabolites between the glycosomes, cytosol, mitochondrion and the host medium. The model is used to examine the effects of a range of culture medium concentrations of oxygen on the glycolysis of T. brucei. Our results are in good agreement with steady-state experiments. We also find that under aerobic conditions, increasing the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase induces complex dynamics in the system. We report the presence of three distinct types of these dynamics. Varying the oxygen concentration in the medium can induce the transition between these dynamics."
293,Cryopreservation of protozoan parasites.,10.1016/j.cryobiol.2003.10.004,2004-02-19,[],"Conventional methods for the propagation and preservation of parasites in vivo or in vitro have some limitations, including the need for labor, initial isolation and loss of strains, bacterial, and fungal contamination, and changes in the original biological and metabolic characteristics. All these disadvantages are considerably reduced by cryopreservation. In this study, we examined the effects of various freezing conditions on the survival of several protozoan parasites after cryopreservation. The viability of Entamoeba histolytica was improved by seeding (p < 0.05, chi2 test), while this was not so effective for Trichomonas vaginalis. Of six cryoprotectants examined, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me(2)SO), and glycerol showed the strongest cryoprotective effects. The optimum conditions for using Me(2)SO were a concentration of 10% with no equilibration, and those for glycerol were a concentration of 15% with equilibration for 2h. The optimum cooling rate depended on the parasite species. Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Leishmania amazonensis were successfully cryopreserved over a wide range of cooling rates, whereas the survival rates of E. histolytica, T. vaginalis, Pentatrichomonas hominis, and Blastocystis hominis were remarkably decreased when frozen at improper rates. Unlike the cooling rate, exposure of the protozoans to a rapid thawing method produced better motility for all parasites."
294,Separate insertion and deletion subcomplexes of the Trypanosoma brucei RNA editing complex.,10.1016/s1097-2765(03)00286-7,2003-10-11,[],"The Trypanosoma brucei editosome catalyzes the maturation of mitochondrial mRNAs through the insertion and deletion of uridylates and contains at least 16 stably associated proteins. We examined physical and functional associations among these proteins using three different approaches: purification of complexes via tagged editing ligases TbREL1 and TbREL2, comprehensive yeast two-hybrid analysis, and coimmunoprecipitation of recombinant proteins. A purified TbREL1 subcomplex catalyzed precleaved deletion editing in vitro, while a purified TbREL2 subcomplex catalyzed precleaved insertion editing in vitro. The TbREL1 subcomplex contained three to four proteins, including a putative exonuclease, and appeared to be coordinated by the zinc finger protein TbMP63. The TbREL2 subcomplex had a different composition, contained the TbMP57 terminal uridylyl transferase, and appeared to be coordinated by the TbMP81 zinc finger protein. This study provides insight into the molecular architecture of the editosome and supports the existence of separate subcomplexes for deletion and insertion editing."
295,Mass spectrometric analysis of the editosome and other multiprotein complexes in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/S1044-0305(03)00126-0,2003-07-03,[],"The composition of the editosome, a multi-protein complex that catalyzes uridine insertion and deletion RNA editing to produce mature mitochondrial mRNAs in trypanosomes, was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The editosomes were isolated by column chromatography, glycerol gradient sedimentation, and monoclonal antibody affinity purifications. At least 16 proteins form the catalytic core of the editosome, and additional associated proteins were identified. Analyses of mitochondrial fractions identified several non-editosome proteins and multi-protein complexes. These studies contribute to the functional annotation of T. brucei genome."
296,The efficacy of ascofuranone in a consecutive treatment on Trypanosoma brucei brucei in mice.,10.1016/s1383-5769(03)00012-6,2003-06-12,[],"Consecutive administration of ascofuranone without glycerol was found to have therapeutic efficacy against Trypanosoma brucei brucei infection in mice. A suspension of ascofuranone (25-100 mg/kg) was administrated intraperitoneally every 24 h for 1-4 consecutive days to trypanosome-infected mice and efficacy was compared with oral treatment. With intraperitoneal administration, all mice treated with 100 mg/kg ascofuranone for 4 consecutive days were cured. On contrary, with oral treatment a higher dose of ascofuranone (400 mg/kg) was needed for 8 consecutive days to cure the mice. With intraperitoneal treatment, parasitemia was strongly suppressed, with almost all long slender bloodstream forms of the parasite changed to short stumpy forms by day 3 and the parasites have been eliminated 4 days after the start of treatment. These ascofuranone-induced short stumpy forms were morphologically analogous to the stumpy forms 2 days after peak parasitemia of pleomorphic clone of T. b. brucei GUTat 3.1. However, the properties of ubiquinol oxidase activity, which is the target of ascofuranone, in mitochondria isolated from before and after treatment, were almost same. The enzymatic activities of ubiquinol oxidase were only decreased to approximately 30% within a day after treatment, and then kept at nearly the same level. In the present study, we have improved regimen for administration of ascofuranone without glycerol, and demonstrated that consecutively administrated ascofuranone showed trypanocidal effects in T. b. brucei infected mice. Our present results strongly suggest that consecutive administration of ascofuranone may be an effective chemotherapy for African trypanosomiasis."
297,Alternative oxidase present in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei may act to lower the mitochondrial production of superoxide.,10.1016/s0003-9861(03)00196-6,2003-06-05,[],"The mitochondrial electron transfer chain present in the procyclic form of the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei contains both cytochrome c oxidase and an alternative oxidase (TAO) as terminal oxidases that reduce oxygen to water. By contrast, the electron transfer chain of the primitive mitochondrion present in the bloodstream form of T. brucei contains only TAO as the terminal oxidase. TAO functions in the bloodstream forms to oxidize the ubiquinol produced by the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle that results in the oxidation of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate produced by glycolysis. The function, however, of TAO in the procyclic forms is unknown. In this study, we found that inhibition of TAO by the specific inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid stimulates the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in trypanosome mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial alteration and increased oxidation of cellular proteins. Moreover, the activity and protein content of TAO in procyclic trypanosomes were increased when cells were incubated in the presence of hydrogen peroxide or antimycin A, the cytochrome bc1 complex inhibitor, which also results in increased ROS production. We suggest that one function of TAO in procyclic cells may be to prevent ROS production by removing excess reducing equivalents and transferring them to oxygen."
298,"Is the Trypanosoma brucei REL1 RNA ligase specific for U-deletion RNA editing, and is the REL2 RNA ligase specific for U-insertion editing?",10.1074/jbc.M303317200,2003-05-16,[],"It was shown previously that the REL1 mitochondrial RNA ligase in Trypanosoma brucei was a vital gene and disruption affected RNA editing in vivo, whereas the REL2 RNA ligase gene could be down-regulated with no effect on cell growth or on RNA editing. We performed down-regulation of REL1 in procyclic T. brucei (midgut insect forms) by RNA interference and found a 40-50% inhibition of Cyb editing, which has only U-insertions, as well as a similar inhibition of ND7 editing, which has both U-insertions and U-deletions. In addition, both U-insertion and U-deletion in vitro pre-cleaved editing were inhibited to similar extents. We also found little if any effect of REL1 down-regulation on the sedimentation coefficient or abundance of the RNA ligase-containing L-complex (Aphasizhev, R., Aphasizheva, I., Nelson, R. E., Gao, G., Simpson, A. M., Kang, X., Falick, A. M., Sbicego, S., and Simpson, L. (2003) EMBO J. 22, 913-924), suggesting that the inhibition of both insertion and deletion editing was not due to a disruption of the L-complex. Together with the evidence that down-regulation of REL2 has no effect on cell growth or on RNA editing in vivo or in vitro, these data suggest that the REL1 RNA ligase may be active in vivo in both U-insertion and U-deletion editing. The in vivo biological role of REL2 remains obscure."
299,Structures of Plasmodium falciparum triosephosphate isomerase complexed to substrate analogues: observation of the catalytic loop in the open conformation in the ligand-bound state.,10.1107/s0907444902015433,2002-11-28,[],"The glycolytic enzymes of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) are attractive drug targets as the parasites lack a functional tricarboxylic cycle and hence depend heavily on glycolysis for their energy requirements. Structural comparisons between Pf triosephosphate isomerase (PfTIM) and its human homologue have highlighted the important differences between the host and parasite enzymes [Velanker et al. (1997), Structure, 5, 751-761]. Structures of various PfTIM-ligand complexes have been determined in order to gain further insight into the mode of inhibitor binding to the parasite enzyme. Structures of two PfTIM-substrate analogue complexes, those of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) and glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), have been determined and refined at 2.4 A resolution. Both complexes crystallized in the monoclinic space group P2(1), with a molecular dimer in the asymmetric unit. The novel aspect of these structures is the adoption of the 'loop-open' conformation, with the catalytic loop (loop 6, residues 166-176) positioned away from the active site; this loop is known to move by about 7 A towards the active site upon inhibitor binding in other TIMs. The loop-open form in the PfTIM complexes appears to be a consequence of the S96F mutation, which is specific to the enzymes from malarial parasites. Structural comparison with the corresponding complexes of Trypanosoma brucei TIM (TrypTIM) shows that extensive steric clashes may be anticipated between Phe96 and Ile172 in the 'closed' conformation of the catalytic loop, preventing loop closure in PfTIM. Ser73 in PfTIM (Ala in all other known TIMs) appears to provide an anchoring water-mediated hydrogen bond to the ligand, compensating for the loss of a stabilizing hydrogen bond from Gly171 NH in the closed-loop liganded TIM structures."
300,Further probing of the substrate specificities and inhibition of enzymes involved at an early stage of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis.,10.1016/s0008-6215(02)00187-8,2002-11-16,[],"1-D-6-O-(2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-1-O-hexadecyl-myo-inositol (14), 1-D-6-O-(2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-myo-inositol 1-(octadecyl phosphate) (18), 1-D-6-O-(2-amino-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-myo-inositol 1-(1,2-di-O-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate) (24), 1-D-6-O-(2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-myo-inositol 1-(1,2-di-O-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate) (30) and the corresponding 2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl analogue 36 have been prepared and tested in cell-free assays as substrate analogues/inhibitors of alpha-(1 --> 4)-D-mannosyltransferases that are active early on in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthetic pathways of Trypanosoma brucei and HeLa (human) cells. The corresponding N-acetyl derivatives of these compounds were similarly tested as candidate substrate analogues/inhibitors of the N-deacetylases present in both systems. Following on from an early study, 1-L-6-O-(2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-2-O-methyl-myo-inositol 1-(1,2-di-O-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate) (44) was prepared and tested as an inhibitor of the trypanosomal alpha-(1 --> 4)-D-mannosyltransferase.

301,Establishment of a binding assay for protein kinase C isozymes using synthetic C1 peptides and development of new medicinal leads with protein kinase C isozyme and C1 domain selectivity.,10.1016/s0163-7258(02)00196-1,2002-08-23,[],"Conventional and novel protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes contain two cysteine-rich C1 domains (C1A and C1B), both of which are candidate phorbol-12, 13-dibutyrate (PDBu)-binding sites. We synthesized C1 peptides of 50-70 residues corresponding to all PKC isozyme C1 domains using an Fmoc solid-phase strategy. These C1 peptides were successfully folded by zinc treatment, as monitored by electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We measured the K(d)'s of [3H]PDBu for all PKC C1 peptides. Most of the C1 peptides, except for delta-C1A and theta-C1A, showed strong PDBu binding affinities with K(d)'s in the nanomolar range (0.45-7.4 nM) comparable with the respective whole PKC isozymes. The resultant C1 peptide library can be used to screen for new ligands with PKC isozyme and C1 domain selectivity. Non-tumor-promoting 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol and bryostatin 1 showed relatively strong binding to all CIA peptides of novel PKCs (delta, epsilon, and eta). In contrast, the tumor promoters (-)-indolactam-V, ingenol-3-benzoate, and PDBu bound selectively to all C1B peptides of novel PKCs. The preference of tumor promoters for the domain might be related to tumorigenesis since recent investigations proposed the involvement of novel PKCs in tumor promotion in vivo using transgenic or knockout mice. Moreover, we recently have found that a new lactone analogue of benzolactams (6) shows significant selectivity in PKCeta-C1B binding."

These two diseases are caused by Trypanosoma spp. Recently, an enzyme of a glycolytic pathway, NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, of Leishmania mexicana was crystallized and its structure determined by x-ray crystallography. This structure has offered an excellent template for modeling of the homologous enzymes from another Trypanosoma species. Here, a homology model of the T. brucei enzyme based on the x-ray structure of LmGPDH has been generated. This model was used as the starting point for molecular dynamics simulation in a water box. The analysis of the molecular dynamics trajectory indicates that the functionally important motifs have both a very stable secondary structure and tertiary arrangement."
303,An easily dissociated 26 S proteasome catalyzes an essential ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.M109029200,2002-02-21,[],"The 26 S proteasome, a complex between the 20 S proteasome and 19 S regulatory units, catalyzes ATP-dependent degradation of unfolded and ubiquitinated proteins in eukaryotes. We have identified previously 20 S and activated 20 S proteasomes in Trypanosoma brucei, but not 26 S proteasome. However, the presence of 26 S proteasome in T. brucei was suggested by the hydrolysis of casein by cell lysate, a process that requires ATP but is inhibited by lactacystin, and the lactacystin-sensitive turnover of ubiquitinated proteins in the intact cells. T. brucei cDNAs encoding the six proteasome ATPase homologues (Rpt) were cloned and expressed. Five of the six T. brucei Rpt cDNAs, except for Rpt2, were capable of functionally complementing the corresponding rpt deletion mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Immunoblots showed the presence in T. brucei lysate of the Rpt proteins, which co-fractionated with the yeast 19 S proteasome complex by gel filtration and localized in the 19 S fraction of a glycerol gradient. All the Rpt and putative 19 S non-ATPase (Rpn) proteins were co-immunoprecipitated from T. brucei lysate by individual anti-Rpt antibodies. Treatment of T. brucei cells with a chemical cross-linker resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of 20 S proteasome with all the Rpt and Rpn proteins that sedimented in a glycerol gradient to the position of 26 S proteasome. These data demonstrate the presence of 26 S proteasome in T. brucei cells, which apparently dissociate into 19 S and 20 S complexes upon cell lysis. RNA interference to block selectively the expression of proteasome 20 S core and Rpt subunits resulted in significant accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins accompanied by cessation of cell growth. Expression of yeast RPT2 gene in T. brucei Rpt2-deficient cells could not rescue the lethal phenotype, thus confirming the incompatibility between the two Rpt2s. The T. brucei 11 S regulator (PA26)-deficient RNA interference cells grew normally, suggesting the dispensability of activated 20 S proteasome in T. brucei."
305,"Cloning, heterologous expression and kinetic analysis of glycerol kinase (TbGLK1) from Trypanosoma brucei.",10.1515/BC.2000.132,2001-01-12,[],"We have cloned and sequenced the gene for the glycerol kinase of Trypanosoma brucei (TbGLK1), obtained by RT-PCR. The corresponding mRNA is 2.3 kb in size and contains an ORF encoding a protein with high homology to known glycerol kinases of other organisms. It is 512 amino acids in length with a PTS1-like targeting sequence (AKL) at its C-terminus, suggesting glycosomal compartmentalization of this enzyme. Although Northern blot analysis revealed higher mRNA levels in slender bloodstream forms than in the procyclic insect forms, specific glycerol kinase activities were found to be virtually identical in both life stages. Southern blot analysis suggested a single copy gene, but we were able to clone two alleles utmost similar to each other. Heterologous expression of the trypanosomal glycerol kinase in E. coli enabled us to perform a kinetic analysis of this enzyme. In particular, we have been able to monitor ATP production from glycerol-3-phosphate and ADP, a reaction which, although thermodynamically very unfavorable, is regarded essential for the survival of Trypanosoma brucei under anoxic conditions. Since the unique spatial separation of glycolysis in the kinetoplastida imposes important consequences for the regulation of the energy metabolism in these organisms, we discuss the observed differences between TbGLK1 and glycerol kinases from other organisms in view of its physiological relevance."
306,"Association of two novel proteins, TbMP52 and TbMP48, with the Trypanosoma brucei RNA editing complex.",10.1128/MCB.21.2.380-389.2001,2001-01-03,[],"RNA editing in kinetoplastid mitochondria inserts and deletes uridylates at multiple sites in pre-mRNAs as directed by guide RNAs. This occurs by a series of steps that are catalyzed by endoribonuclease, 3'-terminal uridylyl transferase, 3'-exouridylylase, and RNA ligase activities. A multiprotein complex that contains these activities and catalyzes deletion editing in vitro was enriched from Trypanosoma brucei mitochondria by sequential ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography, followed by glycerol gradient sedimentation. The complex size is approximately 1,600 kDa, and the purified fraction contains 20 major polypeptides. A monoclonal antibody that was generated against the enriched complex reacts with an approximately 49-kDa protein and specifically immunoprecipitates in vitro deletion RNA editing activity. The protein recognized by the antibody was identified by mass spectrometry, and the corresponding gene, designated TbMP52, was cloned. Recombinant TbMP52 reacts with the monoclonal antibody. Another novel protein, TbMP48, which is similar to TbMP52, and its gene were also identified in the enriched complex. These results suggest that TbMP52 and TbMP48 are components of the RNA editing complex."
307,ATP production in isolated mitochondria of procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/s0166-6851(00)00303-0,2000-11-23,[],"Membrane potential-dependent ATP production was measured in mitochondrial fractions of procyclic Trypanosoma brucei using a luciferase based assay. Mitochondria isolated under hypotonic conditions were able to produce ATP using succinate as substrate. The same was observed with mitochondria isolated under isotonic conditions, however, in this case a 6-7-fold higher amount of ATP was produced with glycerol-3-phosphate as substrate. Disruption of the outer membrane of isotonically prepared mitochondria lead to a selective loss of the glycerol-3 phosphate induced ATP production, indicating that glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is a soluble enzyme of the intermembrane space. Isolation of mitochondria under hypotonic conditions, therefore, results in disruption of the outer membrane, whereas in the organelles isolated under isotonic conditions both the membranes remain intact."
308,Adenosine analogues as inhibitors of Trypanosoma brucei phosphoglycerate kinase: elucidation of a novel binding mode for a 2-amino-N(6)-substituted adenosine.,10.1021/jm000287a,2000-11-07,[],"As part of a project aimed at structure-based design of adenosine analogues as drugs against African trypanosomiasis, N(6)-, 2-amino-N(6)-, and N(2)-substituted adenosine analogues were synthesized and tested to establish structure-activity relationships for inhibiting Trypanosoma brucei glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH). Evaluation of X-ray structures of parasite PGK, GAPDH, and GPDH complexed with their adenosyl-bearing substrates led us to generate a series of adenosine analogues which would target all three enzymes simultaneously. There was a modest preference by PGK for N(6)-substituted analogues bearing the 2-amino group. The best compound in this series, 2-amino-N(6)- [2''(p-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]adenosine (46b), displayed a 23-fold improvement over adenosine with an IC(50) of 130 microM. 2-[[2''-(p-Hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]amino]adenosine (46c) was a weak inhibitor of T. brucei PGK with an IC(50) of 500 microM. To explore the potential of an additive effect that having the N(6) and N(2) substitutions in one molecule might provide, the best ligands from the two series were incorporated into N(6),N(2)-disubstituted adenosine analogues to yield N(6)-(2''-phenylethyl)-2-[(2'' -phenylethyl)amino]adenosine (69) as a 30 microM inhibitor of T. brucei PGK which is 100-fold more potent than the adenosine template. In contrast, these series gave no compounds that inhibited parasitic GAPDH or GPDH more than 10-20% when tested at 1.0 mM. A 3.0 A X-ray structure of a T. brucei PGK/46b complex revealed a binding mode in which the nucleoside analogue was flipped and the ribosyl moiety adopted a syn conformation as compared with the previously determined binding mode of ADP. Molecular docking experiments using QXP and SAS program suites reproduced this ""flipped and rotated"" binding mode."
311,A potential target enzyme for trypanocidal drugs revealed by the crystal structure of NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leishmania mexicana.,10.1016/s0969-2126(00)00135-0,2000-05-10,[],"NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) catalyzes the interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and L-glycerol-3-phosphate. Although the enzyme has been characterized and cloned from a number of sources, until now no three-dimensional structure has been determined for this enzyme. Although the utility of this enzyme as a drug target against Leishmania mexicana is yet to be established, the critical role played by GPDH in the long slender bloodstream form of the related kinetoplastid Trypanosoma brucei makes it a viable drug target against sleeping sickness.
The 1.75 A crystal structure of apo GPDH from L. mexicana was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) techniques, and used to solve the 2.8 A holo structure in complex with NADH. Each 39 kDa subunit of the dimeric enzyme contains a 189-residue N-terminal NAD-binding domain and a 156-residue C-terminal substrate-binding domain. Significant parts of both domains share structural similarity with plant acetohydroxyacid isomeroreductase. The discovery of extra, fatty-acid like, density buried inside the C-terminal domain indicates a possible post-translational modification with an associated biological function.
The crystal structure of GPDH from L. mexicana is the first structure of this enzyme from any source and, in view of the sequence identity of 63%, serves as a valid model for the T. brucei enzyme. The differences between the human and trypanosomal enzymes are extensive, with only 29% sequence identity between the parasite and host enzyme, and support the feasibility of exploiting the NADH-binding site to develop selective inhibitors against trypanosomal GPDH. The structure also offers a plausible explanation for the observed inhibition of the T. brucei enzyme by melarsen oxide, the active form of the trypanocidal drugs melarsoprol and cymelarsan."
312,Glycosyl phosphatidylinositol myristoylation in African trypanosomes. New intermediates in the pathway for fatty acid remodeling.,10.1074/jbc.275.19.14147,2000-05-09,[],"Glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors in the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei are unusual in that their two fatty acids are myristate. The myristates are added in the final stages of GPI biosynthesis in a remodeling reaction. Remodeling occurs first at the sn-2 position of glycerol, involving removal of a longer fatty acid and subsequent attachment of myristate. The second myristate is then incorporated into the sn-1 position, but the mechanism has been unclear due to the unavailability of a reliable cell-free system supporting complete remodeling. Here, we first refined the cell-free system (by removing Mn(2+) ions), thereby allowing efficient production of the dimyristoylated GPI precursor. Using this improved system, we made three new discoveries concerning the pathway for fatty acid remodeling. First, we discovered a monomyristoylated GPI (known as glycolipid theta') as an intermediate involved in remodeling at the sn-1 position. Second, we found an alternative pathway for production of glycolipid theta, the first lyso intermediate in remodeling. The alternative pathway involves an inositol-acylated GPI known as glycolipid lyso-C'. Finally, we found that there is significant breakdown of GPIs during remodeling in the cell-free system, and we speculate that this breakdown has a regulatory role in GPI biosynthesis."

Cloning, molecular characterization and mutagenesis.",10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01238.x,2000-04-12,[],"Trypanosoma brucei contains two tandemly arranged genes for glycerol kinase. The downstream gene was analysed in detail. It contains an ORF for a polypeptide of 512 amino acids. The polypeptide has a calculated molecular mass of 56 363 Da and a pI of 8.6. Comparison of the T. brucei glycerol kinase amino-acid sequence with the glycerol kinase sequences available in databases revealed positional identities of 39.0-50.4%. The T. brucei glycerol kinase gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells and the recombinant protein obtained was purified and characterized biochemically. Its kinetic properties with regard to both the forward and reverse reaction were measured. The values corresponded to those determined previously for the natural glycerol kinase purified from the parasite, and confirmed that the apparent Km values of the trypanosome enzyme for its substrates are relatively high compared with those of other glycerol kinases. Alignment of the amino-acid sequences of T. brucei glycerol kinase and other eukaryotic and prokaryotic glycerol kinases, as well as inspection of the available three-dimensional structure of E. coli glycerol kinase showed that most residues of the magnesium-, glycerol- and ADP-binding sites are well conserved in T. brucei glycerol kinase. However, a number of remarkable substitutions was identified, which could be responsible for the low affinity for the substrates. Most striking is amino-acid Ala137 in T. brucei glycerol kinase; in all other organisms a serine is present at the corresponding position. We mutated Ala137 of T. brucei glycerol kinase into a serine and this mutant glycerol kinase was over-expressed and purified. The affinity of the mutant enzyme for its substrates glycerol and glycerol 3-phosphate appeared to be 3. 1-fold to 3.6-fold higher than in the wild-type enzyme. Part of the glycerol kinase gene comprising this residue 137 was amplified in eight different kinetoplastid species and sequenced. Interestingly, an alanine occurs not only in T. brucei, but also in other trypanosomatids which can convert glucose into equimolar amounts of glycerol and pyruvate: T. gambiense, T. equiperdum and T. evansi. In trypanosomatids with no or only a limited capacity to produce glycerol, a hydroxy group-containing residue is found as in all other organisms: T. vivax and T. congolense possess a serine while Phytomonas sp., Leishmania brasiliensis and L. mexicana have a threonine."
314,Comparative study of Leishmania mexicana and Trypanosoma brucei NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.,10.1016/s0166-6851(99)00204-2,2000-04-01,[],"The NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (G3PDH, EC 1.1.1.8) of Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania mexicana are thought to have different roles in carbohydrate metabolism. Here the physicochemical and kinetic properties of natural G3PDH from T. brucei with the recombinant homologue of L. mexicana which share 63% positional identity are compared. Despite their supposed different functions in energy metabolism of the parasites the two G3PDHs have remarkably similar properties, including pH optima and K(m) value for dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and NADH in the formation of glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) and for NAD+ and G3P in the reverse reaction. Both enzymes are subject inhibition by dihydroxyacetone phosphate at concentrations above 0.2 mM and are inhibited by the trypanocidal drugs suramin and melarsen oxide at sub-micromolar concentrations."
317,Synthesis of some second-generation substrate analogues of early intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway of glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchors.,10.1016/s0008-6215(99)00170-6,1999-12-28,[],"1-D-6-O-(2-Amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-2-O-octyl-myo-inositol 1-(1,2-di-O-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate) (23) and the corresponding 2-O-hexadecyl-D-myo-inositol compound 24 have been prepared as substrate analogues of an early intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchors. 1-D-6-O-(2-Amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-myo-inositol 1-(1,2-di-O-octyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate) has also been prepared as a substrate analogue. Biological evaluation of the analogues 23 and 24 revealed that they are neither substrates nor inhibitors of GPI biosynthetic enzymes in the human (HeLa) cell-free system but are potent inhibitors at different stages of GPI biosynthesis in the Trypanosoma brucei cell-free system."
318,Molecular characterisation of Trypanosoma brucei alkyl dihydroxyacetone-phosphate synthase.,10.1016/s0166-6851(99)00141-3,1999-12-10,[],"Alkyl dihydroxyacetone-phosphate synthase is the second enzyme of the ether-lipid biosynthetic pathway which is responsible for the introduction of the ether linkage between a fatty alcohol and a glycerol present in a subclass of phospholipids, the plasmalogens and possibly in glycolipid membrane anchors. In this study the gene coding for alkyl dihydroxyacetone-phosphate synthase was isolated from Trypanosoma brucei. Southern blot analysis of total genomic DNA suggested the presence of a single copy gene. The analysis, together with sequencing of different cDNA clones showed that the two alleles of the gene differ in only one nucleotide. The gene encodes a protein of 612 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 68,891, not counting the initiator methionine. It carries a type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal (a C-terminal tripeptide--AHL) and a calculated overall positive charge of +10. The gene was expressed in a bacterial system and the corresponding protein carrying a His-tag was purified. The recombinant alkyl dihydroxyacetone-phosphate synthase and the enzyme isolated directly from the glycosomes of bloodstream-form trypanosomes have comparable kinetics. The Km for hexadecanol was 42 microM, while approximately 100 microM of palmitoyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) was necessary for optimal activity. Sodium chloride inhibited both the His-tagged protein and the enzyme isolated from the glycosomes of bloodstream-form and insect stage T. brucei."
319,Inhibition of the plasma glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D by synthetic analogs of lipid A and phosphatidic acid.,10.1006/abbi.1999.1436,1999-11-05,[],"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD), a plasma enzyme with extensive sequence similarity to integrin alpha subunits, is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of lipid A, phosphatidic acid (PA) and lysophosphatidic acid (M. G. Low and K.-S. Huang, J. Biol. Chem. 268, 8480-8490, 1993). In this study we have explored the mechanism of inhibition using synthetic analogs of lipid A, and PA. Monosaccharide analogs of lipid A, which varied in the number and position of the phosphate groups, the type of acyl group, and its linkage to the glucosamine ring, were tested for their ability to inhibit GPI-PLD. A compound (SDZ 880.431) containing 3-aza-glucosamine 1,4-diphosphate as the polar headgroup was identified which had a potency (IC(50) approximately 1 microM) similar to natural lipid A preparations. Removal of either phosphate residue increased the IC(50) markedly. Analogs of PA such as (7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazo-4-yl)amino-PA, ceramide 1-phosphate, and hexadecyl phosphate had approximately IC(50) values ranging from 1 to 5 microM, indicating that considerable variation in the structure of the hydrophobic groups was permissible. Inhibition of GPI-PLD by long-chain PA could not be blocked by high concentrations of glycerol 1-phosphate or dibutyryl PA. These results indicate that the hydrophobic groups do not have a passive role in inhibition but are directly involved in the binding interaction with GPI-PLD. We propose that this diverse group of inhibitors all bind to a common site on GPI-PLD, the central hydrophobic cavity predicted by the beta-propeller model for integrin alpha subunits and GPI-PLD."
321,Differences between the trypanosomal and human GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylases of glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor biosynthesis.,10.1093/glycob/9.4.415,1999-03-25,[],"De-N-acetylation of N-acetylglucosaminyl-phosphatidylino-sitol (GlcNAc-PI) is the second step of glycosylphosphatidylino-sitol (GPI) membrane anchor biosynthesis in eukaryotes. This step is a prerequisite for the subsequent processing of glucosaminyl-phosphatidylinositol (GlcN-PI) that leads to mature GPI membrane anchor precursors, which are transferred to certain proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this article, we used a direct de-N-acetylase assay, based on the release of [14C]acetate from synthetic GlcN[14C]Ac-PI and analogues thereof, and an indirect assay, based on the mannosylation of GlcNAc-PI analogues, to study the substrate specificities of the GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase activities of African trypanosomes and human (HeLa) cells. The HeLa enzyme was found to be more fastidious than the trypanosomal enzyme such that, unlike the trypanosomal enzyme, it was unable to act on a GlcNAc-PI analogue containing 2-O-octyl-d- myo -inositol or on the GlcNAc-PI diastereoisomer containing l- myo -inositol (GlcNAc-P(l)I). These results suggest thatselective inhibition of the trypanosomal de-N-acetylase may be possible and that this enzyme should be considered as a possible therapeutic target. The lack of strict stereospecificity of the trypanosomal de-N-acetylase for the d- myo -inositol component was also seen for the trypanosomal GPI alpha-manno-syltransferases when GlcNAc-P(l)I was added to the trypanosome cell-free system, but not when GlcN-P(l)I was used. In an attempt to rationalize these data, we modeled the structure and dynamics of d-GlcNAcalpha1-6d- myo -inositol-1-HPO4-( sn )-3-glycerol and its diastereoisomer d-GlcNAcalpha1-6l- myo -inositol-1-HPO4-( sn )-3-glycerol. These studies indicate that the latter compound visits two energy minima, one of which resembles the low-energy conformer of former compound. Thus, it is conceivable that the trypanosomal de-N-acetylase acts on GlcNAc-P(l)I when it occupies a GlcNAc-PI-likeconformation and that GlcN-P(l)I emerging from the de-N-acetylase may be channeled to the alpha-mannosyltransferases in this conformation."
322,Affinity chromatography using trypanocidal arsenical drugs identifies a specific interaction between glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma brucei and Cymelarsan.,10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00048.x,1999-01-23,[],"A 36-kDa protein was isolated by affinity chromatography using Cymelarsan, an arsenical drug currently used in African trypanosomiasis treatment, as ligand. This protein was identified as glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Trypanosomal glycerol-3-phosphate was bound covalently, whereas its counterpart from rabbit muscle bound by ionic interaction. Arsenical drugs inhibit the enzyme in a dose-dependent manner. Oxidation of cysteine residues protects against inactivation without significantly diminishing enzymic activity. Drug concentrations giving 50% inhibition of the dehydrogenase activity were determined for the enzyme from both Trypanosoma brucei and rabbit and indicate a higher sensitivity of the trypanosomal enzyme to arsenical drugs and thiol reagents. MS was used to identify residues of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase bound by Cymelarsan; they are not conserved in the mammalian enzyme."
323,A novel glycosylphosphatidylinositol in African trypanosomes. A possible catabolic intermediate.,10.1074/jbc.274.3.1465,1999-01-09,[],"The major glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) in African trypanosomes are glycolipid A, the precursor of the variant surface glycoprotein membrane anchor, and glycolipid C, a species identical to glycolipid A except that it contains an acylated inositol. Both glycolipids A and C contain dimyristoyl glycerol and are efficiently labeled with [3H]myristate in a cell-free system. We now report a novel GPI known as lipid X. This GPI is radiolabeled strongly with [3H]palmitate (and very poorly with [3H]myristate or [3H]stearate) in digitonin-permeabilized cells. The structure of lipid X is Man1GlcNAc-(2O-palmitoyl)-D-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-3(lyso-pa lmitoylglyce rol). Metabolically, lipid X exists as an intermediate, and can be detected only under conditions in which its formation is stimulated (e.g. by EDTA) or its breakdown is inhibited (e.g. by Co2+). Lipid X has not been observed previously because these conditions do not support GPI biosynthesis. We speculate that lipid X is an intermediate in the catabolism of conventional trypanosome GPIs, possibly deriving from breakdown of glycolipid C."

325,Characterization of glycerol uptake in bloodstream and procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2560245.x,1998-09-24,[],"Uptake of glycerol was studied in bloodstream and insect forms of the African parasite Trypanosoma brucei using [14C]glycerol in combination with the oil centrifugation technique. Our kinetic measurements revealed that in bloodstream forms glycerol appeared to be transported by two different mechanisms: firstly by a facilitated-diffusion carrier showing a Km of 0.17 mM and a Vmax of 44 nmol 10(-8) cells min(-1) that predominates at low glycerol concentrations, and secondly by simple diffusion. The effects induced by various inhibitors suggest that uptake is neither sodium dependent nor proton-motive-force driven. The saturable component of transport was phloretin and cytochalasin B sensitive and could also be inhibited by the substrate analogue glyceraldehyde, which led to a 74% decrease in glycerol uptake. In insect forms, however, glycerol is taken up by simple diffusion only. Uptake was insensitive to mercury ions and was not influenced by a variety of different channel inhibitors. Our data show that in T brucei glycerol transport across the plasma membrane occurs by simple diffusion. In addition, bloodstream forms express a carrier protein which promotes a rapid transport at low glycerol concentrations. Expression of this transport protein may account for a selective secretion of intracellular glycerol which otherwise could become toxic for the parasite due to its specific compartmentation of glycolysis."
326,Transformation of monomorphic Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream form trypomastigotes into procyclic forms at 37 degrees C by removing glucose from the culture medium.,10.1016/s0166-6851(98)00055-3,1998-08-27,[],"African trypanosomes have been shown previously to undergo efficient transformation from bloodstream forms to procyclic (insect dwelling) forms in vitro by adding citrate and/or cis-aconitate to the culture medium and lowering incubation temperature to 27 degrees C. In this paper, it is shown that strain 427 monomorphic bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei grown in axenic culture at 37 degrees C can be transformed to procyclic forms by simply replacing the glucose carbon source in the culture medium with glycerol. The removal of glucose from the medium results in the loss of the variant surface glycoprotein, the acquisition of cell surface procyclic acidic repetitive protein, the synthesis of procyclic-specific glycosylphosphatidylinositol precursors and the acquisition of substantial resistance to salicyl hydroxamic acid and glycerol within 72 h. A procyclic-specific cytoskeletal protein, known to be a marker of the late stage of transformation, is fully expressed by 96 h but full trans-sialidase activity appears only after 18-30 days. The transformation process described here is slower and less efficient than that previously described for monomorphic trypanosomes, using citrate and/or cis-aconitate and temperature shift as triggers. However, the separation of the transformation process from these stimuli is significant and the effects of glucose deprivation described here may reflect some of the events that occur in vivo in the tsetse fly midgut, where glucose levels are known to be very low."
327,Formation of reactive oxygen intermediates might be involved in the trypanocidal activity of gallic acid.,10.1248/bpb.21.583,1998-07-10,[],"We investigated the mechanism of the trypanocidal activity of gallic acid (GA). GA-induced trypanocidal activity was significantly reduced by pretreatment with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and/or catalase. The ESR technique with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trapping agent revealed that a DMPO-OH adduct was detected in culture medium containing GA. The intensity of ESR signals of the DMPO-OH adduct was increased in a time dependent manner. SOD also inhibited the formation of GA-induced DMPO-OH adducts. Furthermore, GA enhanced DNA single-strand breaks induced by Fenton reagent. These results suggest the possibility that GA acts as pro-oxidant for trypanocidal activity."
328,The dihydroxyacetonephosphate pathway for biosynthesis of ether lipids in Leishmania mexicana promastigotes.,10.1016/s0166-6851(97)00101-1,1997-09-23,[],"Biosynthetic studies using both [14C]- and [32P]-labelled substrates and a cell-free system to synthesise 1-O-alkyl moieties in glycerolipids, have shown that the three initial steps in ether-lipid biosynthesis in Leishmania mexicana promastigotes resemble those described for mammals and are associated with glycosomes. Purified glycosomes were able to sequentially synthesise the first intermediates of the ether-lipid biosynthetic pathway [acyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP), alkyl-DHAP and acyl/alkyl-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P)] when incubated in the presence of radiolabelled DHAP, palmitoyl-CoA, hexadecanol and NADPH. However, when glycosomes were incubated under the same conditions in the presence of radiolabelled G3P, a rapid synthesis of acyl-G3P and phosphatidic acid was observed without any formation of alkyl-G3P, suggesting that the enzyme alkyl-synthase recognises only acyl-DHAP as substrate. Both the DHAP acyltransferase (DHAP-AT) and alkyl-DHAP synthase activities were located inside glycosomes whereas the alkyl/acyl-DHAP oxidoreductase activity was associated with the cytoplasmic face of the glycosomal membrane. The G3P acyltransferase (G3P-AT) and lyso-phosphatidic acid acyltransferase activities were not found inside glycosomes. The results suggest that the DHAP-AT and G3P-AT activities are catalysed by two distinct enzymes associated with different sub-cellular compartments."
329,Structural characterisation of two forms of procyclic acidic repetitive protein expressed by procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1006/jmbi.1997.1066,1997-06-20,[],"A procyclic acidic repetitive protein (PARP) fraction was purified from long-term cultures of Trypanosoma brucei procyclic forms by a solvent-extraction and reverse phase chromatography procedure. The PARP fraction yielded small quantities of a single N-linked oligosaccharide with the structure Man alpha1-6(Man alpha1-3)Man alpha1-6(Man alpha1-3)Manbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-4GlcNAc (Man5GlcNAc2). Fractionation of PARP on Con A-Sepharose revealed that the majority (80 to 90%) of the PARP fraction did not bind to Con A and was composed of the parpA alpha gene product that contains repeats of -Glu-Pro-Pro-Thr- (GPEET-PARP) and that lacks an N-glycosylation site. This form of PARP has not been previously identified at the protein-level. The minor Con-A-binding fraction was shown to be rich in the previously described form of PARP, encoded by the parpAbeta and/or parpB alpha genes, that contains a -Glu-Pro- repeat domain (EP-PARP) and an N-glycosylation site. Analysis of longer and shorter-term cultures suggested that procyclic cells initially express predominantly EP-PARP that is gradually replaced by GPEET-PARP. Both forms of PARP were shown to contain indistinguishable glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchors, where the conserved GPI core structure is substituted by heterogeneous sialylated branched polylactosamine-like structures that are predicted to form a dense surface glycocalyx above which the polyanionic -Glu-Pro-Pro-Thr- and -Glu-Pro- repeat domains are displayed. The phosphatidylinositol (PI) component of the GPI anchor was shown to be a mixture of 2-O-acyl-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-(sn-1-stearoyl-2-lyso-glycerol) and 2-O-acyl-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-(sn-1-octadecyl-2-lyso-glycerol), where the acyl chain substituting the inositol ring showed considerable heterogeneity. Mass spectrometric and light scattering experiments both suggested an average mass of approximately 15 kDa for GPEET-PARP, with individual glycoforms ranging from about 12 kDa to 20 kDa, that is consistent with its amino acid and carbohydrate composition. A measured translational diffusion coefficient of 3.9 x 10(7) cm2 s(-1) indicates that this molecule has a highly elongated shape. The possible functions of these unusual glycoproteins are discussed."
330,Characterization of a multicatalytic proteinase complex (20S proteasome) from Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1016/s0162-3109(97)00038-6,1997-06-01,[],"African trypanosomes are tsetse-transmitted protozoan parasites that cause sleeping sickness in humans and 'Nagana' in animals. A high relative molecular mass multicatalytic proteinase complex (MCP) was purified and biochemically characterized from the cytosolic fraction of Trypanosoma brucei brucei. The isolation procedure consisted of fractionation of the lysate by high speed centrifugation, chromatography on Q-sepharose molecular sieve filtration on Sephacryl S-300, chromatography on HA-Ultrogel and glycerol density gradient centrifugation (10-40%). The final enzyme preparation yielded a single protein band corresponding to a relative molecular mass of 630 kDa on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The enzyme hydrolyses a wide range of peptide substrates characteristic of chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, peptidylglutamylpeptide-hydrolysing activities determined by fluorogenic peptides, Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-NHMec, Z-Arg-Arg-NHMec and Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-beta NA, respectively. The enzyme was found to have a wide variation in pH optimal activity profile, with optimum activity against Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-NHMec at 7.8, Z-Arg-Arg-NHMec at pH 10.5 and Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-beta NA at pH 8.0, showing that the different activities are distinct. The enzyme hydrolysed oxidized proteins. In addition, the chymotryptic and trypsin-like activities were susceptible to inhibition by peptide aldehyde inhibitors with variable inhibition effects. The study demonstrates the presence of a non-lysosomal proteasome pathway of intracellular protein degradation in the bloodstream form of T. b. brucei. Further, the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyse most oxidized proteins, and the high immunogenicity exhibited suggests a possible involvement of the enzyme in pathogenesis of the disease."
331,"Signal transduction in macrophages by glycosylphosphatidylinositols of Plasmodium, Trypanosoma, and Leishmania: activation of protein tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C by inositolglycan and diacylglycerol moieties.",10.1073/pnas.94.8.4022,1997-04-15,[],"The perturbation of various glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored surface proteins imparts profound regulatory signals to macrophages, lymphocytes and other cell types. The specific contribution of the GPI moieties to these events however is unclear. This study demonstrates that purified GPIs of Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei, and Leishmania mexicana origin are sufficient to initiate signal transduction when added alone to host cells as chemically defined agonists. GPIs (10 nM-1 microM) induce rapid activation of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) p59(hck) in macrophages. The minimal structural requirement for PTK activation is the evolutionarily conserved core glycan sequence Man alpha1-2Man alpha1-6Man alpha1-4GlcN1-6myo-inositol. GPI-associated diacylglycerols independently activate the calcium-independent epsilon isoform of protein kinase C. Both signals collaborate in regulating the downstream NF-kappa B/rel-dependent gene expression of interleukin 1alpha, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, and inducible NO synthase. The alkylacyl-glycerol-containing iM4 GIPL of L. mexicana, however, is unable to activate protein kinase C and inhibits TNF expression in response to other agonists, establishing signaling specificity among structurally distinct GPIs. GPI alone appears sufficient to mimic the activities of malaria parasite extracts in the signaling pathway leading to TNF expression. A mAb to GPI blocks TNF induction by parasite extracts indicating that GPI is a necessary agent in this response. As protozoal GPIs are closely related to their mammalian counterparts, the data indicate that GPIs do indeed constitute a novel outside-in signaling system, acting as both agonists and second messenger substrates, and imparting at least two separate signals through the structurally distinct glycan and fatty acid domains. These activities may underlie aspects of pathology and immune regulation in protozoal infections."
336,Glycosyl-phosphatidylinositols of Trypanosoma congolense: two common precursors but a new protein-anchor.,10.1006/jmbi.1996.0451,1996-08-16,[],"The parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma congolense exhibits a dense surface coat which is pivotal for immunoevasion of the parasite. This dense surface coat is made of a single protein species, the variant surface glycoprotein, which is present in a high copy number. The protein is anchored to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor. A detailed study of the structure of T. congolense strain 423 (clone BENat 1.3) variant surface glycoprotein glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor was performed. Radioactively labelled core-glycan prepared by dephosphorylation, deamination and reduction was analysed by high-pH anion-exchange chromatography, size-exclusion and lectin affinity chromatography. Additionally the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor core-glycan was purified from a bulk preparation of variant surface glycoprotein and subjected to mass spectrometry and methylation analysis. Using these methods we could identify a novel galactose-beta 1,6-N-acetyl-glucosamine-beta 1,4-branch modifying the mannose adjacent to the glucosamine of the mannose-alpha 1,2-mannose-alpha 1,6-mannose-alpha 1,4-glucosamine core-glycan of the variant surface glycoprotein glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor. Furthermore the biosynthetic pathway leading to this novel structure was investigated. Two putative glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor precursors were identified having structures identical to the previously characterized Trypanosoma brucei brucei glycolipids P2 and P3 (also designated glycolipid A and C) consistent with a trimannosyl core and a dimyristoyl-glycerol. Both glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor precursors of T. congolense do not possess the side-branch modification found on the mature protein membrane anchor, implying that the sugar side-chain is added to the anchor during its passage through the Golgi-apparatus."
337,Purification and characterization of proteasomes from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/s0166-6851(96)02599-6,1996-06-01,[],"Proteasomes are multisubunit proteases that exist universally among eukaryotes. They have multiple proteolytic activities, and are believed to have important roles in regulating cell cycle, selective intracellular proteolysis, and antigen presentation. To determine the possible role that proteasomes may play in controlling the life cycle of African trypanosomes, we have isolated proteasomes from the bloodstream and the insect (procyclic) forms of Trypanosoma brucei by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and glycerol gradient fractionation in the presence of ATP. No 26 S proteasome homologs was identified in T. brucei under these experimental conditions. The proteasomes isolated from these two forms of T. brucei are very similar to the rat blood cell 20 S proteasome in their general appearance under the electron microscope. The profile of trypanosome proteasome subunits in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) has eight visible protein bands with molecular weights ranging from 23 to 34 kDa, and cross-reacted very poorly with the anti-human 20 S proteasome antibodies on immunoblots. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the parasite proteasomes shows a similar number of major subunits with pI's ranging from 4.5 to 7. Using a variety of fluorogenic peptides as substrates, the trypanosome proteasomes exhibited unusually high trypsin-like, but somewhat lower chymotrypsin-like activities, as compared to the rat 20 S proteasome. These proteolytic activities were, however, insensitive to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), tosyl-phenylalanine chloromethylketone (TPCK), tosyl-lysine chloromethylketone (TLCK) and trans-epoxy succinyl-L-leucylamido-(4 guanidino) butane (E-64), but the trypsin-like activity of trypanosome proteasomes was inhibited by leupeptin, an aldehyde known to inhibit the trypsin-like activity of mammalian proteasomes, thus ruling out possible contamination by other serine or cysteine proteases. Some quantitative differences in the substrate specificities between the proteasomes from bloodstream and procyclic forms were indicated, which may play a role in determining the differential protein turnovers at two different stages of development of T. brucei."

Stuart), Science 266:114-117,1994) sediments with a peak of approximately 20S. RNA helicase, terminal uridylyl transferase, RNA ligase, and adenylation activities, which may have a role in editing, cosediment in a broad distribution, with most of each activity at 35 to 40S. Most ATPase 6 (A6) guide RNA and unedited A6 mRNA sediments at 20 to 30S, with some sedimenting further into the gradient, while most edited A6 mRNA sediments at >35S. Several mitochondrial proteins which cross-link specifically with guide RNA upon UV treatment also sediment in glycerol gradients. Notably, a 65-kDa protein sediments primarily at approximately 20S, a 90-kDa protein sediments at 35 to 40S, and a 25-kDa protein is present at <10S. Most ribonucleoprotein complexes that form with gRNA in vitro sediment at 10 to 20S, except for one, which sediments at 30 to 45S.

This cDNA was subsequently used to obtain genomic clones containing glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes. Two tandemly arranged genes were detected in these clones. Characterization of one of the genes showed that it codes for a polypeptide of 353 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 37,651 Da and a calculated net charge of +8. Using the T.b. brucei gene as a probe, a corresponding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was also identified in a genomic library of Leishmania mexicana mexicana. The L.m. mexicana gene codes for a polypeptide of 365 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 39,140 Da and a calculated net charge of +8. The amino-acid sequences of both polypeptides are 63% identical and carry a type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) SKM and -SKL at their respective C-termini. Moreover, the L.m. mexicana polypeptide also carries a short N-terminal extension reminiscent of a mitochondrial transit sequence. Subcellular localisation analysis showed that in L.m. mexicana the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity co-fractionated both with mitochondria and with glycosomes. This is not the case in T. brucei, where the enzyme is predominantly glycosomal. The two trypanosomatid sequences resemble their prokaryotic homologues (32-36%) more than their eukaryotic counterparts (25-31%) and carry typical prokaryotic signatures. The possible reason for this prokaryotic nature of a trypanosomatid glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is discussed."

Searching of the protein database with the trypanosome translated amino acid sequence identified glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.8) from various prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms as the optimal scoring protein. Surprisingly, the eukaryotic trypanosome enzyme showed the highest degree of sequence identity with the corresponding enzyme from the prokaryote Escherichia coli. The trypanosome molecule was expressed in Escherichia coli and found to be enzymatically active, thus confirming the identity of the molecule as an NAD(+)-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. A monoclonal antibody specific for the 38-kDa protein was used to localize the enzyme to glycosomes. Immunoblotting showed that the monoclonal antibody bound to a 38-kDa protein in African trypanosomes but not in T. cruzi, Leishmania or Crithidia. The enzyme has a pI of 9.1, a net charge of +17 and contains the peroxisome-like targeting tripeptide SKM at its C-terminus, all characteristic of glycosomal enzymes. Amino acids predicted to be involved in the NAD(+)-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase active site have diverged from those of the mammalian enzyme. Kinetic analyses of the trypanosome GPD and GPD from rabbit muscle showed that the Km values of the two enzymes are different. The data suggest that the trypanosome protein may be a candidate target for rational drug design."
342,RNA ligase and its involvement in guide RNA/mRNA chimera formation. Evidence for a cleavage-ligation mechanism of Trypanosoma brucei mRNA editing.,10.1074/jbc.270.13.7233,1995-03-31,[],RNA editing in Trypanosoma brucei results in the addition and deletion of uridine residues within several mitochondrial mRNAs. Editing is thought to be directed by guide RNAs and may proceed via a chimeric guide RNA/mRNA intermediate. We have previously shown that chimera-forming activity sediments with 19 S and 35-40 S mitochondrial ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). In this report we examine the involvement of RNA ligase in the production of chimeric molecules in vitro. Two adenylylated proteins of 50 and 57 kDa co-sediment on glycerol gradients with RNA ligase activity as components of the ribonucleoprotein particles. The two adenylylated proteins differ in sequence and contain AMP linked via a phosphoamide bond. Both proteins are deadenylylated by the addition of ligatable RNA substrate with the concomitant release of AMP and by the addition of pyrophosphate to yield ATP. Incubation with nonligatable RNA substrate results in an accumulation of the adenylylated RNA intermediate. These experiments identify the adenylylated proteins as RNA ligases. AMP release from the mitochondrial RNA ligase is also concomitant with chimera formation. Inhibition by nonhydrolyzable analogs indicates that both RNA ligase and chimera-forming activities require alpha-beta bond hydrolysis of ATP. Deadenylylation of the ligase inhibits chimera formation. These results strongly suggest the involvement of RNA ligase in in vitro chimera formation and support the cleavage-ligation mechanism for kinetoplastid RNA editing.

This class of compounds was selected with the expectation of their having similar inhibitory activity to but greater solubility than the esters and hydroxamic acids noted above and greater resistance to serum hydrolases in vivo. We predicted that such properties would allow an inhibitor of the trypanosome alternative oxidase to be coadministered with glycerol as a means of providing treatment for infections by African trypanosomes. As expected, such benzamides were both more soluble and more stable, some being more active against the target enzyme than the corresponding ester. One, N-n-butyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzamide, was selected for evaluation in vivo against T. brucei brucei. When combined with glycerol, this benzamide was found to be curative. A regimen wherein 450 mg of N-n-butyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzamide per kg and 15 g of glycerol per kg were given hourly in three divided doses cured 17 of 19 mice with established T. brucei brucei infections. This combination is more active in vivo than any other designed to block simultaneously both the unique respiratory electron transport system and the anaerobic glycolytic pathways of these pathogenic protozoa."
350,Native mRNA editing complexes from Trypanosoma brucei mitochondria.,10.1002/j.1460-2075.1992.tb05543.x,1992-12-01,[],"The aim of this study was to identify multicomponent complexes involved in kinetoplastid mitochondrial mRNA editing. Mitochondrial extracts from Trypanosoma brucei were fractionated on 10-30% glycerol gradients and assayed for RNAs and activities potentially involved in editing, including pre-edited mRNA, guide RNA (gRNA), endonuclease, terminal uridylyltransferase (TUTase), RNA ligase and gRNA-mRNA chimera-forming activities. These experiments suggest that two distinct editing complexes exist. Complex I (19S) consists of gRNA, TUTase, RNA ligase and chimera-forming activity. Complex II (35-40S) is composed of gRNA, preedited mRNA, RNA ligase and chimera-forming activity. These studies provide the first evidence that editing occurs in a multicomponent complex. The possible roles of complex I, complex II and RNA ligase in editing are discussed."
352,Purification of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1139/o92-020,1992-02-01,[],"A protein has been purified from the membranes of bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei. The purified material contained a single polypeptide chain of molecular mass 67 kilodaltons as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; under ""native"" conditions it migrated through a Sephacryl S-300 column with a similar molecular mass. The purified protein catalysed electron transfer from sn-glycerol 3-phosphate to oxygen with the subsequent formation of water. Electron transfer by the purified enzyme to O2 was dependent on the presence of low concentrations of the mediator phenazine methosulfate. This protein is clearly the major membrane-bound sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, but it also has some characteristics suggestive of the trypanosome alternative oxidase activities."

We have identified and characterized snRNP complexes of SL, U2, U4, and U6 RNAs in T. brucei extracts by a combination of glycerol gradient sedimentation, CsCl density centrifugation, and anti-m3G immunoprecipitation. Both the SL RNP and the U4/U6 snRNP contain salt-stable cores; the U2 snRNP, in contrast to other eucaryotic snRNPs, is not stable under stringent ionic conditions. Two distinct complexes of U6 RNA were found, a U6 snRNP and a U4/U6 snRNP. The structure of the SL RNP was analyzed in detail by oligonucleotide-directed RNase H protection and by in vitro reconstitution. Our results indicate that the 3' half of SL RNA constitutes the core protein-binding domain and that protein components of the SL RNP also bind to the U2 and U4 RNAs. Using antisense RNA affinity chromatography, we identified a set of low-molecular-mass proteins (14.8, 14, 12.5, and 10 kDa) as components of the core SL RNP."

TIM from Trypanosoma brucei brucei has been crystallized at pH 7.0 in 2.4 M-ammonium sulphate. The well-diffracting crystals have one dimer per asymmetric unit. The structure has been refined at 1.83 A resolution with an R-factor of 18.3% for all data between 6 A and 1.83 A (37,568 reflections). The model consists of 3778 protein atoms and 297 solvent atoms. Subunit 1 is involved in considerably more crystal contacts than subunit 2. Correlated with these differences in crystal packing is the observation that only in the active site of subunit 2 is a sulphate ion bound. Furthermore, significant differences with respect to structure and flexibility are observed in three loops near the active site. In particular, there is a 7 A positional difference of the tip of the flexible loop (loop 6) when comparing subunit 1 and subunit 2. Also, the neighbouring loops (loop 5 and loop 7) have significantly different conformations and flexibility. In subunit 1, loop 6 is in an ""open"" conformation, in subunit 2, loop 6 is in an ""almost closed"" conformation. Only in the presence of a phosphate-containing ligand, such as glycerol-3-phosphate, does loop 6 take up the ""closed"" conformation. Loop 6 and loop 7 (and also to some extent loop 5) are rather flexible in the almost closed conformation, but well defined in the open and closed conformations. The closing of loop 6 (167 to 180), as observed in the almost closed conformation, slightly changes the main-chain conformation of the catalytic glutamate, Glu167, leading to a change of the chi 1 angle of this residue from approximately -60 degrees to approximately 60 degrees and the weakening of the hydrogen bonds between its polar side-chain atoms and Ser96. In the closed conformation, in the presence of glycerol-3-phosphate, the main-chain atoms of Glu167 remain in the same position as in the almost closed conformation, but the side-chain has rotated around the CA-CB bond changing chi 1 from approximately 60 degrees to approximately -60 degrees. In this new position the hydrogen bonding to Ser96 is completely lost and also a water-mediated salt bridge between OE2(Glu167) and NE(Arg99) is lost. Comparison of the two independently refined subunits, showed that the root-mean-square deviation for all 249 CA atoms is 0.9 A; for the CA atoms of the beta-strands this is only 0.2 A. The average B-factor for all subunit 1 and subunit 2 atoms is 20 A2 and 25 A2, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

In mixtures containing 50 mM triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.2, 25% glycerol and 0.5 mM inorganic phosphate the enzyme remained active and could be purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 417 units mg-1 and a yield of 65%. The enzyme has an activation energy of 31.9 kJ mol-1. Magnesium and potassium ions are essential for activity. Cobalt or manganese ions replace Mg2+ but this leads to a decrease in maximal velocity. Potassium ions can be substituted by ammonium ions, while sodium ions behave as a competitive inhibitor with respect to both K+ and NH4+. All metal ions studied displayed sigmoidal kinetics. The enzyme is activated, with decreasing efficiency by fructose 2-phosphorothioate 6-phosphate, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. They all display hyperbolic kinetics. Glycerate 2,3-bisphosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, CoASAc, oxalate, AMP, ADP, and ATP inhibit the enzyme. At substrate saturation PK was activated by Pi up to a concentration of 0.8 mM. At higher Pi concentrations the enzyme is inhibited. The enzyme is unaffected by most amino acids, only phenylalanine stimulates and tyrosine inhibits."
356,Mitochondrial development in Trypanosoma brucei brucei transitional bloodstream forms.,10.1016/0166-6851(91)90085-k,1991-04-11,[],"Intermediate and short stumpy bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei are transitional stages in the differentiation of mammal-infective long slender bloodstream forms into the procyclic forms found in the midgut of the tsetse vector. Although the mitochondria of the proliferative long slender forms do not accumulate rhodamine 123, the mitochondria of the transitional forms attain this ability thus revealing the development of an electromotive force (EMF) across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The EMF is inhibited by 2,4-dinitrophenol, rotenone and salicylhydroxamic acid but not by antimycin A or cyanide. Consequently, NADH dehydrogenase, site I of oxidative phosphorylation, is the source of the EMF and the plant-like trypanosome alternative oxidase (TAO) supports the electron flow serving as the terminal oxidase of the chain. Although the TAO is present in the long slender forms as well, it serves only as the terminal oxidase for electrons from glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The data presented here, combined with older data, lead to the conclusion that the mitochondria of transitional intermediate and short stumpy forms likely produce ATP. This putative production is either by F1F0 ATPase driven by the complex I proton pump or by mitochondrial substrate level phosphorylation, or most likely by both. These conclusions contrast with the previously held dogma that all bloodstream form mitochondria are incapable of ATP production."

In accordance with previously published reports bloodstream populations produced pyruvate as the major end product of glucose catabolism, together with very small amounts of CO2, succinate and glycerol. During differentiation pyruvate excretion decreased within 48 h to the low levels produced by 28-day procyclic stages. Concomitant with the decline in pyruvate formation, acetate appeared as a new product and the rates of respiratory CO2 increased considerably. The amount of carbon released with these compounds could account for nearly all of the glucose carbon consumed. Rates of glucose utilization and formation of acetate and CO2 in cells differentiated for 48 h were essentially the same as those found in 28-day procyclics. Succinate and glycerol excretion remained low during the entire transformation process, and no significant difference in the pattern and quantities of end products were found between the two trypanosome strains. During trypanosome differentiation the changes in metabolism were associated with marked alterations in enzyme activity levels. Activities of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD+), succinate dehydrogenase and fumarase were not detectable in bloodstream trypomastigotes but appeared upon differentiation for 24 h. An exception was citrate synthase whose activity was not demonstrable until 48 h postinoculation into culture. After 48 h the majority of the TCA cycle enzyme activities continued to increase steadily until day 28. Pyruvate kinase activity decreased in differentiating cells after 48 h to about 25% of the level found in bloodstream trypomastigotes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
360,The adaptability of the active site of trypanosomal triosephosphate isomerase as observed in the crystal structures of three different complexes.,10.1002/prot.340100106,1991-01-01,[],"Crystals of triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei brucei have been used in binding studies with three competitive inhibitors of the enzyme's activity. Highly refined structures have been deduced for the complexes between trypanosomal triosephosphate isomerase and a substrate analogue (glycerol-3-phosphate to 2.2 A), a transition state analogue (3-phosphonopropionic acid to 2.6 A), and a compound structurally related to both (3-phosphoglycerate to 2.2 A). The active site structures of these complexes were compared with each other, and with two previously determined structures of triosephosphate isomerase either free from inhibitor or complexed with sulfate. The comparison reveals three conformations available to the ""flexible loop"" near the active site of triosephosphate isomerase: open (no ligand), almost closed (sulfate), and fully closed (phosphate/phosphonate complexes). Also seen to be sensitive to the nature of the active site ligand is the catalytic residue Glu-167. The side chain of this residue occupies one of two discrete conformations in each of the structures so far observed. A ""swung out"" conformation unsuitable for catalysis is observed when sulfate, 3-phosphoglycerate, or no ligand is bound, while a ""swung in"" conformation ideal for catalysis is observed in the complexes with glycerol-3-phosphate or 3-phosphonopropionate. The water structure of the active site is different in all five structures. The results are discussed with respect to the triosephosphate isomerase structure function relationship, and with respect to an on-going drug design project aimed at the selective inhibition of glycolytic enzymes of T. brucei."
361,Purification and characterization of glycerol kinase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(90)90126-7,1990-11-01,[],"Glycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.30)(GK) from the glycosomes of Trypanosoma brucei has been purified and its kinetic properties have been examined. It has a molecular weight of approximately 53,000 and exists in solution as a monomer. This GK has a broad pH optimum, with equal activity between pH 7 and 9.5. Its catalytic mechanism appears to be random bi bi, with some cooperativity in substrate binding at high pH. The apparent Michaelis constants are: Kglycerol = 0.26 +/- 0.02 mM and KATP = 0.19 +/- 0.02 mM at pH 7.4, and Kglycerol = 0.17 +/- 0.03 mM and KATP = 0.26 +/- 0.02 mM at pH 9.0. Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) up to 10 mM displays virtually no product inhibition of the forward reaction, but ADP is a weak inhibitor, competitive with ATP and uncompetitive with glycerol. The forward reaction is catalyzed very efficiently in vitro, but the reverse reaction proceeds at an extremely low rate, consistent with its unfavorable delta G. Under anaerobic conditions T. brucei GK is thought to convert ADP and G3P to ATP and glycerol rapidly inside the intact glycosome, where it is tightly coupled to the other glycosomal enzymes. Our kinetic analyses suggest that GK may not rely on any unusual intrinsic properties to catalyze this reverse reaction: rather, the unusually high intraglycosomal concentrations of G3P and ADP, and the presence of efficient ATP traps, may drive this reaction by mass action."
363,"Structure, biosynthesis, and function of glycosylphosphatidylinositols.",10.1021/bi00475a001,1990-06-12,[],"The last few years have witnessed an explosion in our knowledge of GPI membrane anchors and related glycolipids and molecules where structure details are available, as illustrated in Figure 2. There is now sufficient information on a handful of these molecules to allow a detailed comparison of their chemical structures. Despite a common structural theme, i.e., the presence of mannoglucosaminyl-PI, a great deal of diversity exists in both the glycan structures and the glycerol-linked aliphatic substituents. The complexities of the structures clearly show that a multitechnique approach is required in the elucidation of their structures. The anticipated publication of more structures from a wider range of organisms may reveal even greater diversity, as well as suggesting possible biosynthetic pathways. The details of a potential biosynthetic pathway in T. brucei are becoming apparent, but confirmation of its importance awaits the isolation and characterization of the enzymes involved. Leishmania, in which LPG, GPIs, GIPLs, and GPI membrane anchors are produced, may also provide an interesting system for biosynthetic studies. The recent description of a GPI biosynthetic system in yeast may provide the crucial breakthroughs necessary in unraveling the enzymes and sugar donors involved in the biosynthetic pathway and possibly the role of the GPI membrane anchor in the function of proteins containing these moieties. Knowledge of the solution structure (conformation), in addition to the complete chemical structure, of the T. brucei VSG anchor has led to speculation that the glycan fulfills a space-filling role in the VSG coat. Many other possible roles of GPI membrane anchors have been suggested, including the shedding and turnover of membrane proteins, signal transduction, and intracellular targeting. Nevertheless, the only function of GPIs that we can so far be certain of is that they anchor proteins or polysaccharide to a membrane. Regardless of the roles GPIs may or may not ultimately be shown to play, the fact that such a widely occurring structure has only recently been characterized serves as a reminder of the incompleteness of our knowledge of biological phenomena and the constant possibility of finding novel molecules in obvious places."

Polymerization of the tubulin in vitro yielded long, structurally normal, microtubules and some sheet structures on addition of GTP and incubation at 37 degrees C, in either the presence or the absence of Mg2+. Tubulin assembly was disrupted by glycerol and a selection of microtubule-reactive drugs. Immunological analysis of the purified tubulin revealed tyrosinated and acetylated alpha-tubulin, in addition to defining the migration characteristics of the alpha- and beta-tubulin on one-dimensional SDS/polyacrylamide gels. This is the first isolation of trypanosome tubulin with the ability to form structurally normal microtubules independent of the addition of taxol or nucleating microtubule fragments. The development of the purification procedure thus provides an important step for subsequent study of microtubule-associated protein-tubulin and plasma-membrane-microtubule cytoskeleton interactions of trypanosomes, and increases the potential for development of tubulin-based anti-trypanosome drugs."

This procedure allowed exposure of coupled mitochondria to different substrates. Only succinate and glycerol phosphate (but not NADH-dependent substrates) were capable of stimulating oxygen consumption. Fluorescence studies on intact cells indicated that addition of succinate stimulates NAD(P)H oxidation, contrary to what happens in mammalian mitochondria. Addition of malonate, an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, stimulated NAD(P)H reduction. Malonate also inhibited intact-cell respiration and motility, both of which were restored by further addition of succinate. Experiments carried out with isolated mitochondrial membranes showed that, although the electron transfer from succinate to cytochrome c was inhibitable by antimycin, NADH-cytochrome c reductase was antimycin-insensitive. We postulate that the NADH-ubiquinone segment of the respiratory chain is replaced by NADH-fumarate reductase, which reoxidizes the mitochondrial NADH and in turn generates succinate for the respiratory chain. This hypothesis is further supported by the inhibitory effect on cell growth and respiration of 3-methoxyphenylacetic acid, an inhibitor of the NADH-fumarate reductase of T. brucei."

Glycerol 3-phosphate and ADP accumulated approximately to the same level from anaerobic catabolism of the three hexoses. However, fructose catabolism stopped within 15-20 min but addition of glucose to these already immobilized trypanosomes temporarily caused a rapid characteristic drop in glycerol 3-phosphate level at a rate of 40 nmol/min/10(8) trypanosomes and correspondingly glucose 6-phosphate, glycerol and pyruvate levels were raised. 4. These observations are not consistent with the proposed requirements for the reverse glycerol kinase in anaerobic net ATP production. Instead, we propose a glycerol 3-phosphate:glucose transphosphorylase that catalyses the formation of glycerol and glucose 6-phosphate."

The two activities could be separated from each other by chromatography on both blue Sepharose and anion exchangers. 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase had a Km for both its substrates in the millimolar range. Its activity was dependent on the presence of inorganic phosphate and was inhibited by phosphoenolpyruvate but not by citrate or glycerol 3-phosphate. The Km of fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase was 7 microM; this enzyme was inhibited by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Ki = 10 microM) and, less potently, by fructose 6-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate and glycerol 3-phosphate. Melarsen oxide inhibited 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (Ki less than 1 microM) and fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (Ki = 2 microM) much more potently than pyruvate kinase (Ki greater than 100 microM). The intracellular concentrations of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and hexose 6-phosphate were highest with glucose, intermediate with fructose and lowest with glycerol and dihydroxyacetone as glycolytic substrates. When added with glucose, salicylhydroxamic acid caused a decrease in the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, ATP, hexose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. These studies indicate that the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is mainly controlled by the concentration of the substrates of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase. The changes in the concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate were in agreement with the stimulatory effect of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate on pyruvate kinase. At micromolar concentrations, melarsen oxide blocked almost completely the formation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate induced by glucose, without changing the intracellular concentrations of ATP and of hexose 6-phosphates. At higher concentrations (3-10 microM), this drug caused cell lysis, a proportional decrease in the glycolytic flux, as well as an increase in the phosphoenolypyruvate concentrations which was restricted to the extracellular compartment. Similar changes were induced by digitonin. It is concluded that the lytic effect of melarsen oxide on the bloodstream form of T. brucei is not the result of an inhibition of pyruvate kinase."

In vitro, as well as in vivo, these polypeptides are synthesized at their mature size, and no evidence was found for any processing upon entry into the glycosomes. Continuous and pulse-chase labelling experiments with procyclic trypomastigotes revealed that the enzymes have a half-life in the cytosol of approximately 3 min or less, and then turn over rapidly in the glycosomes, with half-lives as short as 30 min."
377,"Esters of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, highly effective inhibitors of the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase of Trypanosoma brucei brucei.",10.1016/0166-6851(86)90079-4,1986-10-01,[],"Alkyl esters of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid are inhibitors of the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase system of Trypanosoma brucei brucei in vitro and have significant trypanocidal activity in vivo when combined with glycerol. While the parent acid has little inhibitory activity in vitro, the esters are highly active with activity increasing as the chain length of the esterifying alcohol increases. The n-dodecyl ester was more than 400 times as active as salicylhydroxamic acid and 15 times more active than the corresponding p-n-alkyloxybenzhydroxamic acid, one of the most active sn-glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase inhibitors previously reported. When combined with glycerol (to block an alternative pathway of glycolysis) and tested in vitro against intact parasites, this ester was 100 times more effective than salicylhydroxamic acid and 10 times more effective than p-n-dodecyloxybenzhydroxamic acid. It was also active against T. b. brucei in mice when combined with glycerol whereas the latter compound was not. Esters of 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid (gallic acid) were also highly active while those of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid were much less inhibitory and those of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid were inactive. A related compound, 2',4',5'-trihydroxybutyrophenone, was also active as predicted by its structure but was too toxic to be of interest as a drug candidate."
379,Trypanosoma brucei and T. vivax: salicylhydroxamic acid and glycerol treatment of acute and chronically infected rats.,10.1016/0014-4894(86)90013-5,1986-08-01,[],"In rats infected with monomorphic Trypanosoma brucei brucei, the efficacy of the therapy with salicylhydroxamic acid plus glycerol, i.e., combined therapy, decreased with increasing time after infection. It failed completely after the infection was made chronic by suboptimal treatment for 6 weeks. When this chronic infection had been established and ""optimal"" treatment was given, viable trypanosomes could still be detected 1 day later in brain and muscle but not in blood. In most organs, the concentrations of salicylhydroxamic acid and glycerol were lower than in the blood plasma; the maximum concentration of glycerol in the brain was only 20% of that in plasma. The most likely explanation for the failure of the combined therapy is that, in certain tissues, the concentration of the drugs remains too low to kill extravascular trypanosomes. Other explanations, such as the selection of a resistant strain or the survival of (extravascular) forms with a more active mitochondrion, could be excluded with a high degree of probability. Suramin was very effective, even after combined therapy had failed repeatedly, while melarsoprol was less effective. As in combined therapy, the dose of melarsoprol that could cure an acute infection was insufficient to cure a chronic infection. Combined therapy failed after a spontaneous chronic infection with T. b. rhodesiense had existed for 5-7 weeks, but it was effective in T. vivax infected rats even when parasitemia had been present for at least 4 days. Effective alternative schedules for combined therapy were not found."
381,"p-Alkyloxybenzhydroxamic acids, effective inhibitors of the trypanosome glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase.",10.1016/0166-6851(86)90005-8,1986-06-01,[],"Energy production in bloodstream forms of African trypanosomes of the genus Trypanosoma involves two pathways unique to the parasite and which can be blocked by a combination of salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) and glycerol. Although this leads to rapid parasite destruction both in vitro and in vivo, the toxicity of SHAM precludes practical use of SHAM/glycerol as a therapeutic regimen. Based on our hypothesis that SHAM operates by interfering with ubiquinone, we attempted to develop this approach by synthesizing and screening a series of hydroxamic acids which more closely resemble ubiquinone: the p-n-alkyloxybenzhydroxamic acids. We also examined a variety of mono-, di- and trisubstituted benzhydroxamic acids together with a selected group of secondary heterocyclic hydroxamic acids. We found an increase in activity of the p-n-alkyloxy compounds with increasing chain length up to 12 carbon atoms with longer chains offering little advantage. The most active compound, p-n-tetradecyloxybenzhydroxamic acid, had an apparent Ki of 0.43 microM indicating a specific activity 70 times greater than SHAM. Although this represents a vast improvement, the low water solubility of these compounds reduces their bioavailability to the point where they are not practical substitutes for SHAM. Consequently, improvement in the SHAM/glycerol approach to chemotherapy appears to lie with improving solubility by altering lipophilicity of the alkyl side chain."
383,Inhibitors of the mitochondrial cytochrome b-c1 complex inhibit the cyanide-insensitive respiration of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(86)90008-3,1986-06-01,[],"The cyanide-insensitive respiration of bloodstream trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma brucei (75 +/- 8 nmol O2 min-1(mg protein)-1) is completely inhibited by the mitochondrial ubiquinone-like inhibitors 2-hydroxy-3-undecyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (UHNQ) and 5-n-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole (UHDBT). The Ki values for UHDBT (30 nM) and UHNQ (2 microM) are much lower than the reported Ki for salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) (5 microM), a widely used inhibitor of the cyanide-insensitive oxidase. UHNQ also stimulated the glycerol-3-phosphate-dependent reduction of phenazine methosulfate, demonstrating that the site of UHNQ inhibition is on the terminal oxidase of the cyanide-insensitive respiration of T. brucei. These results suggest that a ubiquinone-like compound may act as an electron carrier between the two enzymatic components of the cyanide-insensitive glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase."
390,The aerobic/anaerobic transition of glucose metabolism in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0014-5793(85)81106-6,1985-02-11,[],The ratio of glycerol to pyruvate produced by T. brucei incubated with glucose at various oxygen tensions has been used as an index of the aerobic and anaerobic pathways of glucose metabolism. A minimal model is presented which fits the observed data. The value of the notional K of the aerobic/anaerobic transition from the model is close to that of the Km of trypanosomal glycerophosphate oxidase. The anaerobic pathway appears to be almost completely inoperative at oxygen tensions in the range of those found in venous and arterial blood.
393,Localization of the initial steps in alkoxyphospholipid biosynthesis in glycosomes (microbodies) of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0014-5793(84)80284-7,1984-04-09,[],"Cell fractionation of Trypanosoma brucei cultured procyclic stages showed that the key enzyme of glycerol-ether lipid synthesis, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.42) was exclusively associated with the microbody fraction. These organelles contained in addition 1-acyl glycerol-3-phosphate: NADP+ oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.101) and acyl-CoA reductase and were capable of utilizing DHAP, but not G-3-P, as substrate for lysophosphatidic acid formation. It is concluded that in T. brucei the glycosomes are the exclusive site of the synthesis of precursors for glycerol-ether lipid synthesis and that they contain the entire pathway to form alkoxylipids from glycerol and acyl-CoA."
394,Presence of glycerol and fatty acids in the C-terminal end of a variant surface glycoprotein from Trypanosoma equiperdum.,10.1016/0006-291x(83)91602-9,1983-07-18,[],"The composition of the C-terminal end of a variant surface glycoprotein from Trypanosoma equiperdum (BoTat-1 VSG) has been examined. It has been reported for two Trypanosoma brucei VSGs (Holder, A.A., Biochem. J. (1983), 209, 261-262) that ethanolamine was involved in binding the C-terminal amino acid to an oligosaccharide side chain. Tryptic glycopeptides were prepared from BoTat-1 VSG and analyzed. One of them was found to contain ethanolamine and consequently was assumed to be C-terminal. It was shown that the glycopeptide also included phosphate, glycerol and fatty acids. The fatty acid composition was representative of that of glycerolipids. All the results suggest that the end of the molecule is a core of phosphatidylethanolamine."
395,13C nuclear magnetic resonance studies of anaerobic glycolysis in Trypanosoma brucei spp.,10.1007/BF01121945,1983-02-01,[],"Anaerobic glycolysis in Trypanosoma brucei spp. has been studied by 13C NMR at 50 and 75.5 MHz. The uptake of [U-13C]glucose by cell suspensions of T. b. brucei was monitored by time-course spectroscopy, and while no anomeric specificity was found, the end-products of glycolysis were confirmed as glycerol and pyruvate together with alanine and dihydroxypropionate. The intermediacy of L-glycerol-3-phosphate was also ascertained. The incorporation of C-1 of [1-13C]glucose and of C-6 of [6-13C]glucose into glycerol and pyruvate in T. b. gambiense was quantified by measurement of the longitudinal relaxation times of the species involved. An incorporation to the extent of 66% of each substrate into equimolar amounts of glycerol and pyruvate indicate that Keq for the triosephosphate-isomerase-mediated reaction approaches unity."
397,Role of calcium in trypanocidal drug action.,10.1126/science.6805075,1982-06-18,[],"The synergistic effect of serum on the drug combination of salicylhydroxamic acid plus glycerol, which is active against Trypanosoma brucei, is due to diffusible calcium ions. The synergistic activity can be removed by dialysis of the serum or by addition of calcium chelating agents. A buffer containing calcium can mimic the synergistic activity of serum. This finding may have important implications in the clinical management of African trypanosomiasis in humans. Calcium also has a synergistic effect on melarsoprol, the only drug available for treating sleeping sickness patients with central nervous system involvement, and the concentration of calcium has been reported to be depressed inthe serum of experimentally infected animals."
398,Carbon-13 nuclear-magnetic-resonance studies of glucose catabolism by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1982.tb05836.x,1982-01-01,[],"13C Nuclear magnetic resonance studies have been performed in vivo on Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. The glycolytic pathway has been observed using specifically labelled 13C-enriched glucose and it has been ascertained that there is, under anaerobic conditions, predominant incorporation of C-1 of glucose into glycerol while there is complete randomisation of C-6 of glucose into glycerol and pyruvate. These observations cannot be reconciled by the Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway, purportedly the mechanism by which glucose is catabolised in these organisms, and an alternative pathway must exist. Comparison of whole-cell and acid-lysate 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra concludes that pyruvate may be initially formed bound to a macromolecular species. Also, alanine is found to be a major end product of glucose catabolism."
401,Subcellular compartmentation of glycolytic intermediates in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1981.tb05550.x,1981-09-01,[],"In cell-fractionation experiments most of the glycolytic enzymes in bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei are recovered in a microbody, called the glycosome [Opperdoes, F. R. and Borst, P. (1977) FEBS Lett. 80, 360-364]. To see whether this compartmentation of glycolytic enzymes is accompanied by compartmentation of metabolites we have pulse-labelled intact T. brucei with [U-14C]glucose and followed the incorporation of radioactivity into glycolytic intermediates separated by anion-exchange chromatography. The kinetics of incorporation provide direct evidence for the existence of two pools of glycolytic intermediates. One pool is completely labelled within 15 s and represents 20-30% of total cellular metabolites. Radioactively labelled pyruvate is already produced after 15 s. Since this pool is directly involved in the glycolytic flux, we conclude that it is present in the glycosome. The second pool which represents 70-80% of the total appears not to be directly involved in glycolysis. Its content equilibrates relatively slowly with the glycosomal pool. It probably represents the cytosol. Incorporation of radioactivity into the total glycerol 3-phosphate pool is more rapid than for the other metabolites studied. This indicates rapid mixing of the glycosomal and cell-sap pools of glycerol 3-phosphate, as required for the extra-glycosomal oxidation of glycerol 3-phosphate by the mitochondrial oxidase. In the presence of 1 mM salicylhydroxamic acid, which mimics anaerobiosis, the trypanosome produces equimolar amounts of pyruvate and glycerol. Labelling of glycerol and glycerol 3-phosphate proceeds at identical rates but at all times the specific activity of glycerol is less than that of glycerol 3-phosphate. This is compatible with our earlier proposal that glycerol is made from glycerol 3-phosphate by glycerol kinase. We conclude that glycolysis in trypanosomes takes place in the glycosome and that the membrane of this organelle is poorly permeable to most glycolytic intermediates."
402,Trypanosoma brucei brucei: a systematic screening for alternatives to the salicylhydroxamic acid-glycerol combination.,10.1016/0166-6851(81)90002-5,1981-09-01,[],"Salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) and glycerol, when administered together, cause destruction of bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, both in vitro and in vivo, but the dose required is exceedingly high. In an attempt to improve the efficacy of this drug combination, we examined the ability of various polyols and hydroxamic acids to substitute for glycerol and SHAM, respectively. No satisfactory substitute for glycerol was found. The inhibition of the trypanosomal alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase system (GPO) by SHAM (Ki 21 microM) was uncompetitive. Only primary and secondary aromatic hydroxamates were inhibitory. Among a series of 19 benzhydroxamates, no correlation existed between their acidity or their affinity for iron and their inhibition of the GPO in a cell free preparation. The Ki's of most of the primary hydroxamates ranged from 10 to 24 microM, with the more lipophilic derivatives being slightly more active. The Ki's of secondary hydroxamates were more variable, the best having Ki's of about 10 microM. Several other classes of iron chelators were also evaluated. Tropolones were active with 3-bromo-4,5-benzotropolone being as active as SHAM. 3,4-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde (Ki 15 microM) also inhibited the GPO. On the other hand, diphenylamine and 8-hydroxyquinoline, known inhibitors of the GPO, were 30 to 50 times less active. The results suggest that a lipophilic aromatic iron-chelating agent may be useful as a substitute for SHAM in combination therapy."
404,Trypanosoma brucei: the effect of glycerol on the anaerobic metabolism of glucose.,10.1016/0166-6851(80)90032-8,1980-12-01,[],"Studies measuring the glycolytic intermediate and adenine nucleotide concentrations in Trypanosoma brucei metabolising glucose either aerobically or under conditions where glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase is inactive have shown the following: 1. Inhibition with 0.5 mM salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) accurately simulates anaerobic conditions in T. brucei; 2. On inhibition of respiring cells with 0.5 mM SHAM, the concentrations of most glycolytic intermediates decrease; they decrease further as the concentration of glycerol, an end product, increases. Only the concentration of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate is increased. This increase depends upon the method of preparation but is independent of time and glycerol concentration. 3. Glycerol formation from sn-glycerol-3-phosphate is coupled to the phosphorylation of another compound. The results of these studies are consistent with this compound being ADP; 4, The degree of inhibition of the anaerobic metabolism of glucose exerted by glycerol varies with the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate concentration, implying that the effect of glycerol is at the site of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate: ADP transphosphorylation."
405,Carbohydrate alters the trypanocidal activity of normal human serum with Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(80)90036-5,1980-12-01,[],"Three categories of carbohydrates are distinguished based on their effects on the trypanocidal activity of normal human serum on Trypanosoma brucei. The first category includes carbohydrates such as glucose, mannose and fructose which are utilized by parasites as an energy source. These carbohydrates inhibit the trypanocidal activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The third category, represented by xylose and mannitol, are not energy sources to the parasites but inhibit the trypanocidal activity in a manner similar to the first category carbohydrate. However, at very high concentrations (approximately 140-150 mM), the inhibition is reversed. Glycerol is the only known carbohydrate belonging to the second category. Glycerol enhances the trypanocidal activity of normal human serum and of those sera which normally display no cytotoxic activity, although glycerol serves as an excellent energy source. On the basis of these results, the mechanisms by which these three categories of carbohydrate could alter the trypanocidal activity are discussed in terms of the interaction between a trypanocidal factor and the surface receptor."
414,Ca2+ is essential cofactor for trypanocidal activity of normal human serum.,10.1038/282613a0,1979-12-06,[],"Normal human serum has been known to exert a cytotoxic effect on Trypanosoma brucei subspecies for nearly 80 yr. But in spite of many attempts, no trypanocidal factor was found in human or baboon serum, until Rifkin demostrated a high density lipoprotein (HDL) in normal human serum with trypanocidal activity. The conclusion that this was the trypanocidal factor was supported by the report that serum from patients with Tangier disease, characterised by a severe deficiency of HDL, lacked trypanocidal activity. We report here that Ca2+ is an essential cofactor for the trypanocidal activity of normal human serum, in which alpha2 macroglobulin (alpha 2) might function as a Ca2+-carrier. We further show that D-glucose, D-fructose and D-mannose can suppress the trypanocidal action of normal human serum, whereas glycerol has the opposite effect."
417,An approach to the development of new drugs for African trypanosomiasis.,10.1084/jem.148.2.569,1978-08-01,[],"The inability of the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei brucei to decompose hydrogen peroxide forms the basis of our attempt to develop new pharmacological agents to kill these organisms. Approximately 1-3% of the oxygen consumed by these parasites appears in the form of hydrogen peroxide. Our previous observation that free radical initiators such as heme and hematoporphyrin D proved to be trypanocidal in vitro and in vivo, respectively, prompted this investigation into the mechanism of action of this class of compounds to enhance their therapeutic efficacy. The locus of H2O2 production within the trypanosome was examined using cell-free homogenates. Experiments described herein suggest that H2O2 is formed by the alpha-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase in an adventitious manner, and that no enzymatic means of disposing of this potentially toxic compound are present with the organisms. Naphthoquinones were found to substantially increase the rate of both oxygen consumption and H2O2 production by trypanosomal mitochondrial preparations. Presumably, the naphthoquinones are acting as coenzyme Q analogues. The addition of sublytic concentrations of both naphthoquinones and heme leads to a synergistic lysis of the organisms in vitro. Another approach to increasing the susceptibility of T. b. brucei to free radical damage involved reduction of the intracellular concentration of glutathione. This was accomplished through the use of trypanocidal arsenicals. Melarsenoxide and heme acted synergistically in vitro, an effect which was further enhanced via addition of a naphthoquinone. Moreover, hematoporphyrin D and tryparsamide were shown to have a synergistic effect in T. b. brucei-infected mice."

None of seven known microbody enzymes were detected at all, but glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase, ATPase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase and part of the hyperoxide dismutase and malate dehydrogenase activities were found to be particle-bound after fractionation of homogenates by differential centrifugation. Part of the ATPase activity was sensitive to oligomycin, an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation. This oligomycin-sensitive activity can serve as a specific marker for the mitochondria. More than 80% of the NAD+-linked glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in T. brucei was found to be particulate and latent. The enzyme could be activated by Triton X-100, by the combined action of sonication and salt, but not by salt alone, and partially by freezing and thawing. We conclude that the NAD+-linked glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is located inside an organelle."

Drug resistance among parasites justifies the search for new therapeutic drugs, and the identification of new targets becomes a valuable approach. In this scenario, the glycolysis pathway, which converts glucose into pyruvate, plays an important role in the protozoa energy supply, and it is therefore considered a promising target. In this pathway, triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) plays an essential role in efficient energy production. Furthermore, protozoa TIM shows structural differences with human enzyme counterparts, suggesting the possibility of obtaining selective inhibitors. Therefore, TIM is considered a valid approach to develop new antiprotozoal agents, inhibiting the glycolysis in the parasite.
In this review, we discuss the drug design strategies, structure-activity relationship, and binding modes of outstanding TIM inhibitors against Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, Plasmodium falciparum, Giardia lamblia, Leishmania mexicana, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Entamoeba histolytica.
TIM inhibitors have mainly shown aromatic systems and symmetrical structure, where the size and type of heteroatom are important for enzyme inhibition. This inhibition is mainly based on the interaction with i) the interfacial region of TIM inducing changes on the quaternary and tertiary structure or ii) with the TIM catalytic region, the main pathways that disable the catalytic activity of the enzyme.
Benzothiazole, benzoxazole, benzimidazole, and sulfhydryl derivatives stand out as TIM inhibitors. In silico and in vitro studies have demonstrated that the inhibitors bind mainly at the TIM dimer interface. In this review, the development of new TIM inhibitors as antiprotozoal drugs is demonstrated as an important pharmaceutical strategy that may lead to new therapies for these ancient parasitic diseases."

These diseases are a major burden in the 36 sub-Saharan African countries where the tsetse fly vector is endemic. Untreated trypanosomiasis is fatal and the current treatments are stage-dependent and can be problematic during the meningoencephalitic stage, where no new therapies have been developed in recent years and the current drugs have a low therapeutic index. There is a need for more effective treatments and a better understanding of how these parasites evade the host immune response will help in this regard. The bloodstream form of T. brucei excretes significant amounts of aromatic ketoacids, including indolepyruvate, a transamination product of tryptophan. This study demonstrates that this process is essential in bloodstream forms, is mediated by a specialized isoform of cytoplasmic aminotransferase and, importantly, reveals an immunomodulatory role for indolepyruvate. Indolepyruvate prevents the LPS-induced glycolytic shift in macrophages. This effect is the result of an increase in the hydroxylation and degradation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). The reduction in HIF-1α levels by indolepyruvate, following LPS or trypanosome activation, results in a decrease in production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. These data demonstrate an important role for indolepyruvate in immune evasion by T. brucei."
447,Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1111/mmi.13325,2016-01-11,[],"Pyruvate is a key product of glycolysis that regulates the energy metabolism of cells. In Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness, the fate of pyruvate varies dramatically during the parasite life cycle. In bloodstream forms, pyruvate is mainly excreted, whereas in tsetse fly forms, pyruvate is metabolized in mitochondria yielding additional ATP molecules. The character of the molecular machinery that mediates pyruvate transport across mitochondrial membrane was elusive until the recent discovery of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) in yeast and mammals. Here, we characterized pyruvate import into mitochondrion of T. brucei. We identified mpc1 and mpc2 homologs in the T. brucei genome with attributes of MPC protein family and we demonstrated that both proteins are present in the mitochondrial membrane of the parasite. Investigations of mpc1 or mpc2 gene knock-out cells proved that T. brucei MPC1/2 proteins facilitate mitochondrial pyruvate transport. Interestingly, MPC is expressed not only in procyclic trypanosomes with fully activated mitochondria but also in bloodstream trypanosomes in which most of pyruvate is excreted. Moreover, MPC appears to be essential for bloodstream forms, supporting the recently emerging picture that the functions of mitochondria in bloodstream forms are more diverse than it was originally thought."

In the analysis of the organic acid profile, A. saccharolyticus was cultivated in an acid production medium using two different pH conditions. The specific activities of the enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase (PYC), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and fumarase (FUM), involved in the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) branch, were examined and compared in cells harvested from the acid production medium and a complete medium. The results showed that ambient pH had a significant impact on the pattern and the amount of organic acids produced by A. saccharolyticus. The wild-type strain produced higher amount of malic acid and succinic acid in the pH buffered condition (pH 6.5) compared with the pH non-buffered condition. The enzyme assays showed that the rTCA branch was active in the acid production medium as well as the complete medium, but the measured enzyme activities were different depending on the media. Furthermore, a soluble NADH-dependent fumarate reductase gene (frd) from Trypanosoma brucei was inserted and expressed in A. saccharolyticus. The expression of the frd gene led to an enhanced production of succinic acid in frd transformants compared with the wild-type in both pH buffered and pH non-buffered conditions with highest amount produced in the pH buffered condition (16.2 ± 0.5 g/L). This study demonstrates the feasibility of increasing succinic acid production through the cytosolic reductive pathway by genetic engineering in A. saccharolyticus."

10.1155/2013/910308",2015-09-05,[],"Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) also called sleeping sickness is an infectious disease in humans caused by an extracellular protozoan parasite. The disease, if left untreated, results in 100% mortality. Currently available drugs are full of severe drawbacks and fail to escape the fast development of trypanosoma resistance. Due to similarities in cell metabolism between cancerous tumors and trypanosoma cells, some of the current registered drugs against HAT have also been tested in cancer chemotherapy. Here we demonstrate for the first time that the simple ester, ethyl pyruvate, comprises such properties.
The current study covers the efficacy and corresponding target evaluation of ethyl pyruvate on T. brucei cell lines using a combination of biochemical techniques including cell proliferation assays, enzyme kinetics, phasecontrast microscopic video imaging and ex vivo toxicity tests. We have shown that ethyl pyruvate effectively kills trypanosomes most probably by net ATP depletion through inhibition of pyruvate kinase (Ki = 3.0±0.29 mM). The potential of ethyl pyruvate as a trypanocidal compound is also strengthened by its fast acting property, killing cells within three hours post exposure. This has been demonstrated using video imaging of live cells as well as concentration and time dependency experiments. Most importantly, ethyl pyruvate produces minimal side effects in human red cells and is known to easily cross the blood-brain-barrier. This makes it a promising candidate for effective treatment of the two clinical stages of sleeping sickness. Trypanosome drug-resistance tests indicate irreversible cell death and a low incidence of resistance development under experimental conditions.
Our results present ethyl pyruvate as a safe and fast acting trypanocidal compound and show that it inhibits the enzyme pyruvate kinase. Competitive inhibition of this enzyme was found to cause ATP depletion and cell death. Due to its ability to easily cross the blood-brain-barrier, ethyl pyruvate could be considered as new candidate agent to treat the hemolymphatic as well as neurological stages of sleeping sickness."

These salt bridges provide increased tetramer stability correlated with an enhanced specificity constant (k cat/S 0.5). A detailed kinetic and structural comparison between the potential drug target PYKs from the pathogenic protists T. cruzi, T. brucei and Leishmania mexicana shows that their allosteric mechanism is conserved. By contrast, a structural comparison of trypanosomatid PYKs with the evolutionarily divergent PYKs of humans and of bacteria shows that they have adopted different allosteric strategies. The underlying principle in each case is to maximize (k cat/S 0.5) by stabilizing and rigidifying the tetramer in an active R-state conformation. However, bacterial and mammalian PYKs have evolved alternative ways of locking the tetramers together. In contrast to the divergent allosteric mechanisms, the PYK active sites are highly conserved across species. Selective disruption of the varied allosteric mechanisms may therefore provide a useful approach for the design of species-specific inhibitors."
453,Contribution of pyruvate phosphate dikinase in the maintenance of the glycosomal ATP/ADP balance in the Trypanosoma brucei procyclic form.,10.1074/jbc.M114.567230,2014-05-06,"['Gene Knockout', 'Glucose Metabolism', 'Parasite Metabolism', 'Peroxisome', 'Trypanosoma brucei']","Trypanosoma brucei belongs to a group of protists that sequester the first six or seven glycolytic steps inside specialized peroxisomes, named glycosomes. Because of the glycosomal membrane impermeability to nucleotides, ATP molecules consumed by the first glycolytic steps need to be regenerated in the glycosomes by kinases, such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). The glycosomal pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK), which reversibly converts phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate, could also be involved in this process. To address this question, we analyzed the metabolism of the main carbon sources used by the procyclic trypanosomes (glucose, proline, and threonine) after deletion of the PPDK gene in the wild-type (Δppdk) and PEPCK null (Δppdk/Δpepck) backgrounds. The rate of acetate production from glucose is 30% reduced in the Δppdk mutant, whereas threonine-derived acetate production is not affected, showing that PPDK function in the glycolytic direction with production of ATP in the glycosomes. The Δppdk/Δpepck mutant incubated in glucose as the only carbon source showed a 3.8-fold reduction of the glycolytic rate compared with the Δpepck mutant, as a consequence of the imbalanced glycosomal ATP/ADP ratio. The role of PPDK in maintenance of the ATP/ADP balance was confirmed by expressing the glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinase (PGKC) in the Δppdk/Δpepck cell line, which restored the glycolytic flux. We also observed that expression of PGKC is lethal for procyclic trypanosomes, as a consequence of ATP depletion, due to glycosomal relocation of cytosolic ATP production. This illustrates the key roles played by glycosomal and cytosolic kinases, including PPDK, to maintain the cellular ATP/ADP homeostasis."
454,Revisiting the central metabolism of the bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei: production of acetate in the mitochondrion is essential for parasite viability.,10.1371/journal.pntd.0002587,2013-12-25,[],"The bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness, rely solely on glycolysis for ATP production. It is generally accepted that pyruvate is the major end-product excreted from glucose metabolism by the proliferative long-slender bloodstream forms of the parasite, with virtually no production of succinate and acetate, the main end-products excreted from glycolysis by all the other trypanosomatid adaptative forms, including the procyclic insect form of T. brucei.
A comparative NMR analysis showed that the bloodstream long-slender and procyclic trypanosomes excreted equivalent amounts of acetate and succinate from glucose metabolism. Key enzymes of acetate production from glucose-derived pyruvate and threonine are expressed in the mitochondrion of the long-slender forms, which produces 1.4-times more acetate from glucose than from threonine in the presence of an equal amount of both carbon sources. By using a combination of reverse genetics and NMR analyses, we showed that mitochondrial production of acetate is essential for the long-slender forms, since blocking of acetate biosynthesis from both carbon sources induces cell death. This was confirmed in the absence of threonine by the lethal phenotype of RNAi-mediated depletion of the pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is involved in glucose-derived acetate production. In addition, we showed that de novo fatty acid biosynthesis from acetate is essential for this parasite, as demonstrated by a lethal phenotype and metabolic analyses of RNAi-mediated depletion of acetyl-CoA synthetase, catalyzing the first cytosolic step of this pathway.
Acetate produced in the mitochondrion from glucose and threonine is synthetically essential for the long-slender mammalian forms of T. brucei to feed the essential fatty acid biosynthesis through the ""acetate shuttle"" that was recently described in the procyclic insect form of the parasite. Consequently, key enzymatic steps of this pathway, particularly acetyl-CoA synthetase, constitute new attractive drug targets against trypanosomiasis."
455,Pyruvate kinases have an intrinsic and conserved decarboxylase activity.,10.1042/BJ20130790,2013-12-18,[],"The phosphotransfer mechanism of PYKs (pyruvate kinases) has been studied in detail, but the mechanism of the intrinsic decarboxylase reaction catalysed by PYKs is still unknown. 1H NMR was used in the present study to follow OAA (oxaloacetate) decarboxylation by trypanosomatid and human PYKs confirming that the decarboxylase activity is conserved across distantly related species. Crystal structures of TbPYK (Trypanosoma brucei PYK) complexed with the product of the decarboxylase reaction (pyruvate), and a series of substrate analogues (D-malate, 2-oxoglutarate and oxalate) show that the OAA analogues bind to the kinase active site with similar binding modes, confirming that both decarboxylase and kinase activities share a common site for substrate binding and catalysis. Decarboxylation of OAA as monitored by NMR for TbPYK has a relatively low turnover with values of 0.86 s-1 and 1.47 s-1 in the absence and presence of F26BP (fructose 2,6-bisphosphate) respectively. Human M1PYK (M1 isoform of PYK) has a measured turnover value of 0.50 s-1. The X-ray structures explain why the decarboxylation activity is specific for OAA and is not general for α-oxo acid analogues. Conservation of the decarboxylase reaction across divergent species is a consequence of piggybacking on the conserved kinase mechanism which requires a stabilized enol intermediate."
456,Essential regulation of cell bioenergetics in Trypanosoma brucei by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter.,10.1038/ncomms3865,2013-12-07,[],"Mechanisms of regulation of mitochondrial metabolism in trypanosomes are not completely understood. Here we present evidence that the Trypanosoma brucei mitochondrial calcium uniporter (TbMCU) is essential for the regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics, autophagy and cell death, even in the bloodstream forms that are devoid of a functional respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation. Localization studies reveal its co-localization with MitoTracker staining. TbMCU overexpression increases mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation in intact and permeabilized trypanosomes, generates excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and sensitizes them to apoptotic stimuli. Ablation of TbMCU in RNAi or conditional knockout trypanosomes reduces mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake without affecting their membrane potential, increases the AMP/ATP ratio, stimulates autophagosome formation and produces marked defects in growth in vitro and infectivity in mice, revealing its essentiality in these parasites. The requirement of TbMCU for proline and pyruvate metabolism in procyclic and bloodstream forms, respectively, reveals its role in regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics."
457,`In crystallo' substrate binding triggers major domain movements and reveals magnesium as a co-activator of Trypanosoma brucei pyruvate kinase.,10.1107/S0907444913013875,2013-09-04,"['Trypanosoma brucei', 'pyruvate kinase']","The active site of pyruvate kinase (PYK) is located between the AC core of the enzyme and a mobile lid corresponding to domain B. Many PYK structures have already been determined, but the first `effector-only' structure and the first with PEP (the true natural substrate) are now reported for the enzyme from Trypanosoma brucei. PEP soaked into crystals of the enzyme with bound allosteric activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F26BP) and Mg(2+) triggers a substantial 23° rotation of the B domain `in crystallo', resulting in a partially closed active site. The interplay of side chains with Mg(2+) and PEP may explain the mechanism of the domain movement. Furthermore, it is apparent that when F26BP is present but PEP is absent Mg(2+) occupies a position that is distinct from the two canonical Mg(2+)-binding sites at the active site. This third site is adjacent to the active site and involves the same amino-acid side chains as in canonical site 1 but in altered orientations. Site 3 acts to sequester Mg(2+) in a `priming' position such that the enzyme is maintained in its R-state conformation. In this way, Mg(2+) cooperates with F26BP to ensure that the enzyme is in a conformation that has a high affinity for the substrate."
462,Horizontal gene transfer confers fermentative metabolism in the respiratory-deficient plant trypanosomatid Phytomonas serpens.,10.1016/j.meegid.2012.01.016,2012-02-02,[],"Among trypanosomatids, the genus Phytomonas is the only one specifically adapted to infect plants. These hosts provide a particular habitat with a plentiful supply of carbohydrates. Phytomonas sp. lacks a cytochrome-mediated respiratory chain and Krebs cycle, and ATP production relies predominantly on glycolysis. We have characterised the complete gene encoding a putative pyruvate/indolepyruvate decarboxylase (PDC/IPDC) (548 amino acids) of P. serpens, that displays high amino acid sequence similarity with phytobacteria and Leishmania enzymes. No orthologous PDC/IPDC genes were found in Trypanosoma cruzi or T. brucei. Conservation of the PDC/IPDC gene sequence was verified in 14 Phytomonas isolates. A phylogenetic analysis shows that Phytomonas protein is robustly monophyletic with Leishmania spp. and C. fasciculata enzymes. In the trees this clade appears as a sister group of indolepyruvate decarboxylases of γ-proteobacteria. This supports the proposition that a horizontal gene transfer event from a donor phytobacteria to a recipient ancestral trypanosome has occurred prior to the separation between Phytomonas, Leishmania and Crithidia. We have measured the PDC activity in P. serpens cell extracts. The enzyme has a Km value for pyruvate of 1.4mM. The acquisition of a PDC, a key enzyme in alcoholic fermentation, explains earlier observations that ethanol is one of the major end-products of glucose catabolism under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. This represents an alternative and necessary route to reoxidise part of the NADH produced in the highly demanding glycolytic pathway and highlights the importance of this type of event in metabolic adaptation."
464,Metabonomic investigation of single and multiple strain Trypanosoma brucei brucei infections.,10.4269/ajtmh.2011.10-0402,2011-01-08,[],"Although co-infections are common and can have important epidemiologic and evolutionary consequences, studies exploring biochemical effects of multiple-strain infections remain scarce. We studied metabolic responses of NMRI mice to Trypanosoma brucei brucei single (STIB777AE-Green1 or STIB246BA-Red1) and co-infections using a (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling strategy. All T. b. brucei infections caused an alteration in urinary biochemical composition by day 4 postinfection, characterized by increased concentrations of 2-oxoisocaproate, D-3-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, phenylpyruvate, and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, and decreased levels of hippurate. Although there were no marked differences in metabolic signatures observed in the mouse infected with a single or dual strain of T. b. brucei, there was a slower metabolic response in mice infected with T. b. brucei green strain compared with mice infected with either the red strain or both strains concurrently. Pyruvate, phenylpyruvate, and hippurate were correlated with parasitemia, which might be useful in monitoring responses to therapeutic interventions."
465,Alanine aminotransferase of Trypanosoma brucei--a key role in proline metabolism in procyclic life forms.,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07432.x,2009-11-10,[],"African trypanosomes possess high levels of alanine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.2), although the function of their activity remains enigmatic, especially in slender bloodstream forms where the metabolism of ketoacids does not occur. Therefore, the gene for alanine aminotransferase enzyme in Trypanosoma brucei (TbAAT) was characterized and its function assessed using a combination of RNA interference and gene knockout approaches. Surprisingly, as much as 95% or more of the activity appears to be unnecessary for growth of either bloodstream or procyclic forms respiring on glucose. A combination of RNA interference and NMR spectroscopy revealed an important role for the activity in procyclic forms respiring on proline. Under these conditions, the major end product of proline metabolism is alanine, and a reduction in TbAAT activity led to a proportionate decrease in the amount of alanine excreted along with an increase in the doubling time of the cells. These results provide evidence of a role for alanine aminotransferase in the metabolism of proline in African trypanosomes by linking glutamate produced by the initial oxidative steps of the pathway with pyruvate produced by the final oxidative step of the pathway. This step appears to be essential when proline is the primary carbon source, which is likely to be the physiological situation in the tsetse fly vector."
466,Standard culture medium allows clonal dilution of Trypanosoma brucei procyclic cells after auto-conditioning.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2008.11.003,2008-12-09,[],"Trypanosoma brucei can be cultured in vitro in the mammalian bloodstream form or in the procyclic (PC) form found in the insect vector. Bloodstream trypanosomes can be cloned by limiting dilution, but PCs can only be diluted in conditioned medium, i.e., medium in which PC cells have previously been grown. It is shown here that this limitation does not apply to the most commonly used PC cell strain, Lister 427, if free radicals are removed from the medium. The reported benefit of conditioning media may arise in part from a process of hemin-catalysed depletion of peroxide (""auto-conditioning"") which occurs during extended incubation at growth temperature. Scavenging free radicals by addition of pyruvate also improves PC cell viability. However, other PC cell strains such as Treu 927 require cell-conditioned media unless grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Several other culture parameters that affect growth rates and dilution capability were identified."
468,"Design, synthesis and trypanocidal activity of lead compounds based on inhibitors of parasite glycolysis.",10.1016/j.bmc.2008.03.045,2008-04-05,[],"The glycolytic pathway has been considered a potential drug target against the parasitic protozoan species of Trypanosoma and Leishmania. We report the design and the synthesis of inhibitors targeted against Trypanosoma brucei phosphofructokinase (PFK) and Leishmania mexicana pyruvate kinase (PyK). Stepwise library synthesis and inhibitor design from a rational starting point identified furanose sugar amino amides as a novel class of inhibitors for both enzymes with IC(50) values of 23microM and 26microM against PFK and PyK, respectively. Trypanocidal activity also showed potency in the low micromolar range and confirms these inhibitors as promising candidates for the development towards the design of anti-trypanosomal drugs."
469,Mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.M609037200,2006-12-15,[],"Whereas other organisms utilize type I or type II synthases to make fatty acids, trypanosomatid parasites such as Trypanosoma brucei are unique in their use of a microsomal elongase pathway (ELO) for de novo fatty acid synthesis (FAS). Because of the unusual lipid metabolism of the trypanosome, it was important to study a second FAS pathway predicted by the genome to be a type II synthase. We localized this pathway to the mitochondrion, and RNA interference (RNAi) or genomic deletion of acyl carrier protein (ACP) and beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase indicated that this pathway is likely essential for bloodstream and procyclic life cycle stages of the parasite. In vitro assays show that the largest major fatty acid product of the pathway is C16, whereas the ELO pathway, utilizing ELOs 1, 2, and 3, synthesizes up to C18. To demonstrate mitochondrial FAS in vivo, we radio-labeled fatty acids in cultured procyclic parasites with [(14)C]pyruvate or [(14)C]threonine, either of which is catabolized to [(14)C]acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. Although some of the [(14)C]acetyl-CoA may be utilized by the ELO pathway, a striking reduction in radiolabeled fatty acids following ACP RNAi confirmed that it is also consumed by mitochondrial FAS. ACP depletion by RNAi or gene knockout also reduces lipoic acid levels and drastically decreases protein lipoylation. Thus, octanoate (C8), the precursor for lipoic acid synthesis, must also be a product of mitochondrial FAS. Trypanosomes employ two FAS systems: the unconventional ELO pathway that synthesizes bulk fatty acids and a mitochondrial pathway that synthesizes specialized fatty acids that are likely utilized intramitochondrially."
470,A solanesyl-diphosphate synthase localizes in glycosomes of Trypanosoma cruzi.,10.1074/jbc.M607451200,2006-10-26,[],"We report the cloning of a Trypanosoma cruzi gene encoding a solanesyl-diphosphate synthase, TcSPPS. The amino acid sequence (molecular mass approximately 39 kDa) is homologous to polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases from different organisms, showing the seven conserved motifs and the typical hydrophobic profile. TcSPPS preferred geranylgeranyl diphosphate as the allylic substrate. The final product, as determined by TLC, had nine isoprene units. This suggests that the parasite synthesizes mainly ubiquinone-9 (UQ-9), as described for Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major. In fact, that was the length of the ubiquinone extracted from epimastigotes, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Expression of TcSPPS was able to complement an Escherichia coli ispB mutant. A punctuated pattern in the cytoplasm of the parasite was detected by immunofluorescence analysis with a specific polyclonal antibody against TcSPPS. An overlapping fluorescence pattern was observed using an antibody directed against the glycosomal marker pyruvate phosphate dikinase, suggesting that this step of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway is located in the glycosomes. Co-localization in glycosomes was confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy and subcellular fractionation. Because UQ has a central role in energy production and in reoxidation of reduction equivalents, TcSPPS is promising as a new chemotherapeutic target."
471,Knock-downs of iron-sulfur cluster assembly proteins IscS and IscU down-regulate the active mitochondrion of procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.M513781200,2006-08-03,[],"Transformation of the metabolically down-regulated mitochondrion of the mammalian bloodstream stage of Trypanosoma brucei to the ATP-producing mitochondrion of the insect procyclic stage is accompanied by the de novo synthesis of citric acid cycle enzymes and components of the respiratory chain. Because these metabolic pathways contain multiple iron-sulfur (FeS) proteins, their synthesis, including the formation of FeS clusters, is required. However, nothing is known about FeS cluster biogenesis in trypanosomes, organisms that are evolutionarily distant from yeast and humans. Here we demonstrate that two mitochondrial proteins, the cysteine desulfurase TbiscS and the metallochaperone TbiscU, are functionally conserved in trypanosomes and essential for this parasite. Knock-downs of TbiscS and TbiscU in the procyclic stage by means of RNA interference resulted in reduced activity of the marker FeS enzyme aconitase in both the mitochondrion and cytosol because of the lack of FeS clusters. Moreover, down-regulation of TbiscS and TbiscU affected the metabolism of procyclic T. brucei so that their mitochondria resembled the organelle of the bloodstream stage; mitochondrial ATP production was impaired, the activity of the respiratory chain protein complex ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase was reduced, and the production of pyruvate as an end product of glucose metabolism was enhanced. These results indicate that mitochondrial FeS cluster assembly is indispensable for completion of the T. brucei life cycle."
473,The malate dehydrogenase isoforms from Trypanosoma brucei: subcellular localization and differential expression in bloodstream and procyclic forms.,10.1016/j.ijpara.2005.09.013,2005-12-03,[],"Trypanosoma brucei procyclic forms possess three different malate dehydrogenase isozymes that could be separated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and were recognized as the mitochondrial, glycosomal and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase isozymes. The latter is the only malate dehydrogenase expressed in the bloodstream forms, thus confirming that the expression of malate dehydrogenase isozymes is regulated during the T. brucei life cycle. To achieve further biochemical characterization, the genes encoding mitochondrial and glycosomal malate dehydrogenase were cloned on the basis of previously reported nucleotide sequences and the recombinant enzymes were functionally expressed in Escherichia coli cultures. Mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase showed to be more active than glycosomal malate dehydrogenase in the reduction of oxaloacetate; nearly 80% of the total activity in procyclic crude extracts corresponds to the former isozyme which also catalyzes, although less efficiently, the reduction of p-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate. The rabbit antisera raised against each of the recombinant isozymes showed that the three malate dehydrogenases do not cross-react immunologically. Immunofluorescence experiments using these antisera confirmed the glycosomal and mitochondrial localization of glycosomal and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, as well as a cytosolic localization for the third malate dehydrogenase isozyme. These results clearly distinguish Trypanosoma brucei from Trypanosoma cruzi, since in the latter parasite a cytosolic malate dehydrogenase is not present and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase specifically reduces oxaloacetate."
474,"6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase and fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase in Trypanosomatidae. Molecular characterization, database searches, modelling studies and evolutionary analysis.",10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.04774.x,2005-07-13,[],"Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is a potent allosteric activator of trypanosomatid pyruvate kinase and thus represents an important regulator of energy metabolism in these protozoan parasites. A 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, responsible for the synthesis of this regulator, was highly purified from the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei and kinetically characterized. By searching trypanosomatid genome databases, four genes encoding proteins homologous to the mammalian bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2) were found for both T. brucei and the related parasite Leishmania major and four pairs in Trypanosoma cruzi. These genes were predicted to each encode a protein in which, at most, only a single domain would be active. Two of the T. brucei proteins showed most conservation in the PFK-2 domain, although one of them was predicted to be inactive due to substitution of residues responsible for ligating the catalytically essential divalent metal cation; the two other proteins were most conserved in the FBPase-2 domain. The two PFK-2-like proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. Indeed, the first displayed PFK-2 activity with similar kinetic properties to that of the enzyme purified from T. brucei, whereas no activity was found for the second. Interestingly, several of the predicted trypanosomatid PFK-2/FBPase-2 proteins have long N-terminal extensions. The N-terminal domains of the two polypeptides with most similarity to mammalian PFK-2s contain a series of tandem repeat ankyrin motifs. In other proteins such motifs are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the four different PFK-2/FBPase-2 isoenzymes found in Trypanosoma and Leishmania evolved from a single ancestral bifunctional enzyme within the trypanosomatid lineage. A possible explanation for the evolution of multiple monofunctional enzymes and for the presence of the ankyrin-motif repeats in the PFK-2 isoenzymes is presented."
481,Successful design and synthesis of a polarity-triggered beta-->alpha conformational switch using the side chain interaction index (SCII) as a measure of local structural stability.,10.1021/bi0301744,2004-01-21,[],"Certain sequences within proteins have the ability to undergo an abrupt cooperative conformational switch from beta-strand to helix in response to decreasing polarity of the environment. This behavior was first observed at the CD4 binding site of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1, but evidence has accumulated that polarity-driven beta --> alpha switches may be widespread, serving both to facilitate binding on protein/membrane or protein/protein contact and to signal that docking has occurred. The characteristics identified so far that distinguish switch sequences (a reverse turn at the N-terminus that acts as a helix initiation site, a conserved tryptophan residue downstream, and high potential for both the helix and beta-fold) appear to be necessary but not sufficient, as some otherwise promising sequences found in data bank searches proved not to be capable of cooperative refolding. Analysis of existing switches has led to the development of the side chain interaction index (SCII) as a further parameter characterizing the beta --> alpha polarity-driven switch. Data bank searches using this additional parameter have successfully identified a series of new potential switch sequences. All of them have in common the amino acid tetrad LPCR at the N-terminus and a tryptophan 5-20 residues C-terminal to it. Those with a high SCII as well, when synthesized and tested, exhibited strongly cooperative polarity-driven refolding. Control peptides, containing all other parameters but with a low SCII, did not. Using this new information, an artificial sequence was designed that had a high SCII as well as the initiation site, conserved tryptophan, and high Palpha and Pbeta. When synthesized and tested, this sequence did in fact behave as a conformational switch, refolding cooperatively from beta-fold to helix at a threshold value of 30% TFE. The successful design of a polarity-driven conformational switch opens the possibility of using this motif as a tool in protein engineering."
482,"ATP generation in the Trypanosoma brucei procyclic form: cytosolic substrate level is essential, but not oxidative phosphorylation.",10.1074/jbc.M307872200,2003-09-25,[],"Trypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protist responsible for sleeping sickness in humans. The procyclic form of this parasite, transmitted by tsetse flies, is considered to be dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production. Indeed, its respiration was 55% inhibited by oligomycin, which is the most specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial F0/F1-ATP synthase. However, a 10-fold excess of this compound did not significantly affect the intracellular ATP concentration and the doubling time of the parasite was only 1.5-fold increased, suggesting that oxidative phosphorylation is not essential for procyclic trypanosomes. To further investigate the sites of ATP production, we studied the role of two ATP producing enzymes, which are involved in the synthesis of pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate: the glycosomal pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) and the cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PYK). The parasite was not affected by PPDK gene knockout. In contrast, inhibition of PYK expression by RNA interference was lethal for these cells. In the absence of PYK activity, the intracellular ATP concentration was reduced by up to 2.3-fold, whereas the intracellular pyruvate concentration was not reduced. Furthermore, we show that this mutant cell line still excreted acetate from d-glucose metabolism, and both the wild type and mutant cell lines consumed pyruvate present in the growth medium with similar high rates, indicating that in the absence of PYK activity pyruvate is still present in the trypanosomes. We conclude that PYK is essential because of its ATP production, which implies that the cytosolic substrate level phosphorylation is essential for the growth of procyclic trypanosomes."
483,Activity of D-carnitine and its derivatives on Trypanosoma infections in rats and mice.,10.1051/parasite/2003102147,2003-07-10,[],"Little progress has been made in the treatment of African trypanosomiasis over the past decades. L-carnitine has a major role in glycolysis-based energy supply of blood trypanosomes for it stimulates constant ATP production. To investigate whether administration of the isomer D-carnitine could exert a competitive inhibition on the metabolic pathway of the L-form, possibly resulting in parasite replication inhibition, several formulations of this compound were tested on Trypanosoma lewisi and T. brucei rhodesiense in rodent models. High oral dosages of D-cornitine inner salt and proprionyl-D-carnitine were not toxic to animals and induced about 50% parasite growth inhibition in reversible, i.e. competitive, fashion. A putative mechanism could be an interference in pyruvate kinase activity and hence ATP production. Considering both, lack of toxicity and inhibitory activity, D-carnitine may have a role in the treatment of African trypanosomiasis, in association with available trypanocidal drugs."
484,Expression of the human RNA-binding protein HuR in Trypanosoma brucei increases the abundance of mRNAs containing AU-rich regulatory elements.,10.1093/nar/gkf577,2002-10-18,[],"The salivarian trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei infects mammals and is transmitted by tsetse flies. The mammalian 'bloodstream form' trypanosome has a variant surface glycoprotein coat and relies on glycolysis while the procyclic form from tsetse flies has EP protein on the surface and has a more developed mitochondrion. We show here that the mRNA for the procyclic-specific cytosolic phosphoglycerate kinase PGKB, like that for EP proteins, contains a regulatory AU-rich element (ARE) that destabilises the mRNA in bloodstream forms. The human HuR protein binds to, and stabilises, mammalian mRNAs containing AREs. Expression of HuR in bloodstream-form trypanosomes resulted in growth arrest and in stabilisation of the EP, PGKB and pyruvate, phosphate dikinase mRNAs, while three bloodstream-specific mRNAs were reduced in abundance. The synthesis and abundance of unregulated mRNAs and proteins were unaffected. Our results suggest that regulation of mRNA stability by AREs arose early in eukaryotic evolution."
486,"Succinate secreted by Trypanosoma brucei is produced by a novel and unique glycosomal enzyme, NADH-dependent fumarate reductase.",10.1074/jbc.M201759200,2002-07-26,[],"In all trypanosomatids, including Trypanosoma brucei, glycolysis takes place in peroxisome-like organelles called glycosomes. These are closed compartments wherein the energy and redox (NAD(+)/NADH) balances need to be maintained. We have characterized a T. brucei gene called FRDg encoding a protein 35% identical to Saccharomyces cerevisiae fumarate reductases. Microsequencing of FRDg purified from glycosome preparations, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analyses clearly identified this enzyme as a glycosomal protein that is only expressed in the procyclic form of T. brucei but is present in all the other trypanosomatids studied, i.e. Trypanosoma congolense, Crithidia fasciculata and Leishmania amazonensis. The specific inactivation of FRDg gene expression by RNA interference showed that FRDg is responsible for the NADH-dependent fumarate reductase activity detected in glycosomal fractions and that at least 60% of the succinate secreted by the T. brucei procyclic form (in the presence of d-glucose as the sole carbon source) is produced in the glycosome by FRDg. We conclude that FRDg plays a key role in the energy metabolism by participating in the maintenance of the glycosomal NAD(+)/NADH balance. We have also detected a significant pyruvate kinase activity in the cytosol of the T. brucei procyclic cells that was not observed previously. Consequently, we propose a revised model of glucose metabolism in procyclic trypanosomes that may also be valid for all other trypanosomatids except the T. brucei bloodstream form. Interestingly, H. Gest has hypothesized previously (Gest, H. (1980) FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 7, 73-77) that a soluble NADH-dependent fumarate reductase has been present in primitive organisms and evolved into the present day fumarate reductases, which are quinol-dependent. FRDg may have the characteristics of such an ancestral enzyme and is the only NADH-dependent fumarate reductase characterized to date."
487,The 3.0 A resolution crystal structure of glycosomal pyruvate phosphate dikinase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/s0022-2836(02)00113-4,2002-06-27,[],"The crystal structure of the glycosomal enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase from the African protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei has been solved to 3.0 A resolution by molecular replacement. The search model was the 2.3 A resolution structure of the Clostridium symbiosum enzyme. Due to different relative orientations of the domains and sub-domains in the two structures, molecular replacement could be achieved only by positioning these elements (four bodies altogether) sequentially in the asymmetric unit of the P2(1)2(1)2 crystal, which contains one pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) subunit. The refined model, comprising 898 residues and 188 solvent molecules per subunit, has a crystallographic residual index Rf = 0.245 (cross-validation residual index Rfree = 0.291) and displays satisfactory stereochemistry. Eight regions, comprising a total of 69 amino acid residues at the surface of the molecule, are disordered in this crystal form. The PPDK subunits are arranged around the crystallographic 2-fold axis as a dimer, analogous to that observed in the C. symbiosum enzyme. Comparison of the two structures was carried out by superposition of the models. Although the fold of each domain or sub-domain is similar, the relative orientations of these constitutive elements are different in the two structures. The trypanosome enzyme is more ""bent"" than the bacterial enzyme, with bending increasing from the center of the molecule (close to the molecular 2-fold axis) towards the periphery where the N-terminal domain is located. As a consequence of this increased bending and of the differences in relative positions of subdomains, the nucleotide-binding cleft in the amino-terminal domain is wider in T. brucei PPDK: the N-terminal fragment of the amino-terminal domain is distant from the catalytic, phospho-transfer competent histidine 482 (ca 10 A away). Our observations suggest that the requirements of domain motion during enzyme catalysis might include widening of the nucleotide-binding cleft to allow access and departure of the AMP or ATP ligand."
488,Information transfer in metabolic pathways. Effects of irreversible steps in computer models.,10.1046/j.0014-2956.2001.02616.x,2001-12-12,[],"Various metabolic models have been studied by computer simulation in an effort to understand why allowing for the reversibility of the reaction catalysed by pyruvate kinase, normally considered as irreversible for all practical purposes, significantly altered the behaviour of the model of glycolysis in Trypanosoma brucei [Eisenthal, R. & Cornish-Bowden, A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 5500-5505]. Studies of several much simpler models indicate that the enzymes catalysing early steps in a pathway must receive information about the concentrations of the metabolites at the end of the pathway if a model is to be able to reach a steady state; treating all internal steps as reversible is just one way of ensuring this. Feedback inhibition provides a much better way, and as long as feedback loops are present in a model it makes almost no difference to the behaviour whether the intermediate steps with large equilibrium constants are treated as irreversible. In the absence of feedback loops, ordinary product inhibition of all the enzymes in the chain can also transfer information; this is efficient for regulating fluxes but very inefficient for regulating intermediate concentrations. More complicated patterns of regulation, such as activation of a competing branch or forcing flux through a parallel route, can also serve to some degree as ways of passing information around an irreversible step. However, they normally do so less efficiently than inhibition, because the extent to which an enzyme or a pathway can be activated always has an upper limit (which may be below what is required), whereas most enzymes are inhibited completely at saturating concentrations of inhibitor."
490,Pyruvate : NADP+ oxidoreductase from the mitochondrion of Euglena gracilis and from the apicomplexan Cryptosporidium parvum: a biochemical relic linking pyruvate metabolism in mitochondriate and amitochondriate protists.,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003853,2001-04-25,[],"Most eukaryotes perform the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate in mitochondria using pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Eukaryotes that lack mitochondria also lack PDH, using instead the O(2)-sensitive enzyme pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFO), which is localized either in the cytosol or in hydrogenosomes. The facultatively anaerobic mitochondria of the photosynthetic protist Euglena gracilis constitute a hitherto unique exception in that these mitochondria oxidize pyruvate with the O(2)-sensitive enzyme pyruvate : NADP oxidoreductase (PNO). Cloning and analysis of Euglena PNO revealed that the cDNA encodes a mitochondrial transit peptide followed by an N-terminal PFO domain that is fused to a C-terminal NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) domain. Two independent 5.8-kb full-size cDNAs for Euglena mitochondrial PNO were isolated; the gene was expressed in cultures supplied with 2% CO(2) in air and with 2% CO(2) in N(2). The apicomplexan Cryptosporidium parvum was also shown to encode and express the same PFO-CPR fusion, except that, unlike E. gracilis, no mitochondrial transit peptide for C. parvum PNO was found. Recombination-derived remnants of PNO are conserved in the genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe as proteins involved in sulfite reduction. Notably, Trypanosoma brucei was found to encode homologs of both PFO and all four PDH subunits. Gene organization and phylogeny revealed that eukaryotic nuclear genes for mitochondrial, hydrogenosomal, and cytosolic PFO trace to a single eubacterial acquisition. These findings suggest a common ancestry of PFO in amitochondriate protists with Euglena mitochondrial PNO and Cryptosporidium PNO. They are also consistent with the view that eukaryotic PFO domains are biochemical relics inherited from a facultatively anaerobic, eubacterial ancestor of mitochondria and hydrogenosomes."

PPDK is absent in mammalian cells, but has been found in a wide variety of other organisms, including plants and bacteria. In T. cruzi, two genes (PPDK1 and PPDK2) are present in a tandem array localised on a 1 Mbp chromosome. Northern and Western blot analyses indicates that PPDK is expressed as a 100-kDa protein in epimastigote, amastigote and trypomastigote forms. PPDK1 and PPDK2 encode an identical protein of 100.8 kDa with a C-terminal extension ending with the sequence AKL, a signal for glycosomal import. Both T. cruzi and T. brucei enzymes possess a 23-residue insertion, that is absent in other PPDKs. A three-dimensional alignment with the crystal structure of the enzyme from Clostridium symbiosum predicts that this insertion is located on the surface of the nucleotide-binding domain. Phylogenetic studies indicate that bacterial and protist PPDKs cluster as a separate group from those of plants. The evolutionary implications and possible role of this enzyme in T. cruzi is discussed."
492,Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic investigation of glycosomal pyruvate phosphate dikinase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1107/s0907444900015298,2000-11-28,[],"The PP(i)-dependent glycosomal enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) from Trypanosoma brucei is expressed in the insect stage of the parasite. Its precise function there is still unclear, but the enzyme may catalyze the 'reverse reaction' of transfer of phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to generate pyruvate as a means of scavenging large amounts of pyrophosphate. This protein may represent a target for drug design against diseases caused by trypanosomes and related kinetoplastids. The recombinant protein is 918 amino acids long (predicted molecular mass approximately 100 kDa and pI = 8.9). Crystallization conditions for the recombinant PPDK are reported that result in crystals that diffract X-rays to better than 3.0 A resolution. Their space group is P2(1)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = 121.17, b = 153.5, c = 65.46 A, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees. The crystals, like the protein in solution, are sensitive to temperature and fail to diffract or diffract only to low resolution after ageing for two weeks or longer."

The preferred solution conformation of this structure was determined by using NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations prior to carrying out quantitative structure--activity relationship studies in connection with the insulin signalling process. The ability of 1a to stimulate lipogenesis in rat adipocytes as well as to inhibit cAMP dependent protein kinase and to activate pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase was investigated. Compound 1a did not show any significant activity, which may be taken as a strong indication that the GPI anchors are not the precursors of the IPG mediators."
497,The structure of pyruvate kinase from Leishmania mexicana reveals details of the allosteric transition and unusual effector specificity.,10.1006/jmbi.1999.2918,1999-08-17,[],"Glycolysis occupies a central role in cellular metabolism, and is of particular importance for the catabolic production of ATP in protozoan parasites such as Leishmania and Trypanosoma. In these organisms pyruvate kinase plays a key regulatory role, and is unique in responding to fructose 2,6-bisphosphate as allosteric activator. The determination of the first eukaryotic pyruvate kinase crystal structure in the T-state is reported. A comparison of the leishmania and yeast R-state enzymes reveals fewer differences than the previous comparison of Escherichia coli T-state and rabbit muscle non-allosteric enzymes. Structural changes related to the allosteric transition can therefore be distinguished from those that are a consequence of the inherent wide structural divergence between bacterial and mammalian proteins. The allosteric transition involves significant changes in a tightly packed array of eight alpha helices at the interface near the catalytic site. At the other interface the allosteric transition appears to be accompanied by the bending of a ten-stranded intersubunit beta sheet adjacent to the effector site. Helix Calpha1 makes contacts to the N-terminal helical domain and bridges both interfaces. A comparison of the effector sites of the leishmania and yeast enzymes reveals the structural basis for the different effector specificity. Two loops comprising residues 443-453 and 480-489 adopt very different conformations in the two enzymes, and Lys453 and His480 that are a feature of trypanosomatid enzymes provide probable ligands for the 2-phospho group of the effector molecule. These differences offer an opportunity for the design of drugs that would bind to the trypanosomatid enzymes but not to those of the mammalian host."

Inhibiting glycolytic enzymes may be a novel approach for the development of antitrypanosomatid drugs provided that sufficient parasite versus host selectivity can be obtained. Guided by the crystal structures of human, T. brucei, and Leishmania mexicana glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, we designed adenosine analogs as tight binding inhibitors that occupy the pocket on the enzyme that accommodates the adenosyl moiety of the NAD+ cosubstrate. Although adenosine is a very poor inhibitor, IC50 approximately 50 mM, addition of substituents to the 2' position of ribose and the N6-position of adenosine led to disubstituted nucleosides with micromolar to submicromolar potency in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase assays, an improvement of 5 orders of magnitude over the lead. The designed compounds do not inhibit the human glycolytic enzyme when tested up to their solubility limit (approximately 40 microM). When tested against cultured bloodstream T. brucei and intracellular T. cruzi, N6-(1-naphthalenemethyl)-2'-(3-chlorobenzamido)adenosine inhibited growth in the low micromolar range. Within minutes after adding this compound to bloodstream T. brucei, production of glucose-derived pyruvate ceased, parasite motility was lost, and a mixture of grossly deformed and lysed parasites was observed. These studies underscore the feasibility of using structure-based drug design to transform a mediocre lead compound into a potent enzyme inhibitor. They also suggest that energy production can be blocked in trypanosomatids with a tight binding competitive inhibitor of an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway."
501,"Pyruvate kinase of Trypanosoma brucei: overexpression, purification, and functional characterization of wild-type and mutated enzyme.",10.1006/prep.1998.0918,1998-08-07,[],"A procedure was developed for overexpression of Trypanosoma brucei pyruvate kinase in Escherichia coli. The enzyme was purified to near-homogeneity from the bacterial lysate by first removing nucleic acids and contaminating proteins by protamine sulfate precipitation and subsequent passage over a phosphocellulose column. The purified protein is essentially indistinguishable in its physicochemical and kinetic properties from the enzyme purified from trypanosomes. Furthermore, experiments were undertaken to locate the binding site of the allosteric effector fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Regulation of pyruvate kinase by this effector is unique to trypanosomes and related protozoan organisms. Therefore, a three-dimensional structure model of the enzyme was made, and a putative effector-binding site could be identified in an interdomain cleft. Four residues in this cleft were mutated, and the mutant proteins were produced and purified, using the same methodology as for the wild-type pyruvate kinase. Some mutants showed only minor changes in the activation by the effector. However, substitution of Arg22 by Gly resulted in a 9.2-fold higher S(0.5) for phosphoenolpyruvate and a significantly smaller kcat than the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, the apparent affinity of this mutant for the allosteric effectors fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was 8.2- and 5.2-fold lower than that of its wild-type counterpart. Effector binding was also affected, although to a lesser extent, in a mutant Phe463Val. These data indicate that particularly residue Arg22, but also Phe463, are somehow involved in the binding of the allosteric effectors."

They use salvage pathways to meet their purine requirements. Therefore, purine analogues appear as potential candidates to interfere in trypanosome metabolism. The acyclic adenosine analogue (S)-9-(-3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine ((S)-HPMPA) expressed antitrypanosomal activity in vitro and vivo. When exposed to 20 microM (S)-HPMPA, trypanosomes were arrested in the S-phase of the cell cycle and were unable to enter G2-phase. Thymidine uptake and incorporation was inhibited almost completely. Only nuclear DNA replication was inhibited, while mitochondrial DNA replication and kinetoplast division was not inhibited. The antitrypanosomal effect was reversible when cells were exposed for 12 h. As a control, aphidicolin arrested trypanosomes in the G1-phase of the cell cycle at a concentration of 30 microM. At 20 microM (S)-HPMPA, glycolysis was not effected, while leucine and adenine uptake were reduced with prolonged exposure."

Most of the glycolysis takes place in peroxisome-like organelles, the glycosomes. We characterized in Trypanosoma brucei a single-copy gene encoding a PPi-dependent enzyme, pyruvate, phosphate dikinase (PPDK), which was expressed functionally in Escherichia coli. Specific antibodies detected a 100-kDa protein in procyclic forms but not in mammalian forms of T. brucei, indicating a differential expression. Glycosomal localization of PPDK was determined by immunofluorescence analysis and was confirmed by Western blot analysis on glycosomal fractions by using anti-PPDK antibodies. Expression and localization of recombinant PPDKs in procyclic forms of T. brucei showed that the AKL motif at the C-terminal extremity of PPDK is necessary for glycosomal targeting. PPDK was detected in every trypanosomatid tested-Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma vivax, Trypanosoma cruzi, Phytomonas, Crithidia and Leishmania-with a good correlation between amount of protein and enzymatic activity. The precise role of PPDK in trypanosomatid carbohydrate metabolism remains to be clarified."
506,Regulation of the intracellular pH in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1515/bchm.1997.378.9.1039,1997-11-05,[],"The mechanisms regulating the intracellular pH (pHi) in both forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei (cultured cells) were investigated using the fluorescent probe 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). The pHi values measured were 7.22+/-0.03 in the procyclics and 7.40+/-0.05 in the bloodstream form. In the presence of 24mM HCO3-, pHi values were slightly higher in both forms of trypanosomes suggesting a bicarbonate-linked pH regulation. pHi was more stable in procyclics (between 7.15 and 7.30 in the external pH range 6.4-7.6) than in the bloodstream forms. The amiloride analogue tested decreased pHi, suggesting Na+-driven Na+/H+ antiporters. H+-ATPases also seem to be involved in pHi regulation since the inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide (1 mM) and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (80 microM) induced a rapid acidification in both forms of trypanosomes. Addition of pyruvate caused a cytosol acidification in the bloodstream form only confirming the existence of a diffusion-facilitated carrier for pyruvate, with the cotransport of H+. Our results show that, although similar pH regulation mechanisms seem to exist in both forms of trypanosomes, the procyclics can regulate efficiently their pHi and consequently their plasma membrane potential whereas the bloodstream forms cannot always maintain their pHi and are easily depolarized following a small acid load."
507,Isolation and partial characterisation of insulin-mimetic inositol phosphoglycans from human liver.,10.1006/bmme.1997.2607,1997-08-01,[],"Extracts of human liver were found to contain activities which copurified and coeluted with the two major subtypes of mediators (type A and type P) isolated from insulin-stimulated rat liver. The putative type A mediator from human liver inhibited cAMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine heart, decreased phosphoenolypyruvate carboxykinase mRNA levels in rat hepatoma cells, and stimulated lipogenesis in rat adipocytes. The putative type P mediator stimulated bovine heart pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. Both fractions were able to stimulate proliferation of EGFR T17 fibroblasts and the type A was able to support growth in organotypic cultures of chicken embryo cochleovestibular ganglia. Both activities were resistant to Pronase treatment and the presence of carbohydrates, phosphate, and free-amino groups were confirmed in the two fractions. These properties are consistent with the structure/ function characteristics of the type A and P inositolphosphoglycans (IPG) previously characterized from rat liver. Further, the ability of the human-derived mediators to interact with rat adipocytes and bovine-derived metabolic enzymes suggests similarity in structure between the mediators purified from different species. Galactose oxidase-susceptible membrane-associated glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPI) have been proposed to be the precursors of IPG. GPI was purified from human liver membranes followed by treatment with galactose oxidase and reduction with NaB3H4. Serial t.l.c. revealed three radiolabeled bands which comigrated with the putative GPI precursors found in rat liver. These galactose-oxidase-reactive lipidic compounds, however, were only partially susceptible to hydrolysis with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus thuringiensis and were resistant to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Trypanosoma brucei. These data indicate that IPG molecules with insulin-like biological activities are present in human liver."

We developed a serum-free medium (HMI-244) in which serum in HMI-9 was replaced by fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, bovine alpha 2-macroglobulin, bovine beta-lipoprotein, d-biotin, retinol, beta-alanine, L-anserine nitrate salt, L-ornithine hydrochloride, O-phosphorylethanolamine, sarcosine, taurine, adenosine-5'-triphosphate, 2'-deoxycytidine-5'-monophosphate, 2'-deoxyguanosine-5'-monophosphate, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid. Maximum cell densities and population doubling times were 2.6 x 10(6) cells/ml; 10.6 hours and 2.2 x 10(6) cells/ml; 10.9 hours for T. brucei and T. evansi, respectively. Bloodstream forms continued to proliferate in the serum-free cultures for more than 90 days and the trypomastigotes retained their morphological characteristics and infectivity to mice. If validated, this serum-free medium may help reduce future interlaboratory variability in biochemical, immunological, molecular biological and drug sensitivity studies on these parasites."

Further incubation of the G1-restricted organisms in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM hydroxyurea resulted in their reversible arrest after a G1 checkpoint beyond which serum was not required for progress into and through S. Progress of the G1-restricted T. brucei through the G1 checkpoint was linear and required continuous incubation with exogenous serum growth factors. These were principally low and high density lipoproteins; both lipoproteins triggered G1 progression in a dose- and time-dependent manner whilst their removal by immunoaffinity chromatography severely reduced the capacity of FBS to stimulate G1 progression. Serum-induced progress of T. brucei through G1 was Ca(2+)-independent, but required gene transcription, protein synthesis, and continuous kinase activity that was inhibited by tyrphostin 51 and DAPH 1 which typically inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity. The tyrphostin 51-sensitive catalytic activity was not required for T. brucei protein synthesis, glycolysis, or S phase progression but was required for tyrosine phosphorylation of several polypeptides, none of which was specifically associated with serum-induced G1 progression."

The sensitivity of pyruvate transport for alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate and the compound UK5099 [alpha-cyano-beta-(1-phenylindol-3-yl)acrylate], which are known to be selective inhibitors of pyruvate (monocarboxylate) transporters present in mitochondria and the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells, was examined. The trypanosomal pyruvate carrier was found to be rather insensitive to inhibition by alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (Ki = 17 mM) but could be completely blocked by UK5099 (Ki = 49 microM). Inhibition of pyruvate transport resulted in the retention, and concomitant accumulation, of pyruvate within the trypanosomes, causing acidification of the cytosol and osmotic destabilization of the cells. Our results indicate that this physiological state has serious metabolic consequences and ultimately leads to cell death; thereby identifying the pyruvate carrier as a possible target for chemotherapeutic intervention."
511,Catabolism of tryptophan by Trypanosoma evansi.,10.1111/j.1550-7408.1995.tb01616.x,1995-11-01,[],"Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, which causes human African trypanosomiasis, catabolizes the aromatic amino acid tryptophan via an initial aminotransferase catalyzed reaction to form several indole end products, which have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of trypanosomiasis. To determine if this same pathway exists in T. evansi, the closely related trypanosome pathogen of domestic animals, tryptophan catabolism was examined in vitro and in vivo. As is the case with human African trypanosomes, T. evansi catabolized tryptophan to form indole-3-pyruvic acid and smaller amounts of indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-lactic acid. Large concentrations of indole-3-pyruvic acid are excreted in urine of trypanosome-infected mice. However, indole-3-ethanol could not be detected in incubates of T. evansi or T. b. gambiense, even though the latter species had previously been reported to form this neutral metabolite. A new, previously unreported tryptophan metabolite was isolated and partially characterized from incubates of T. evansi and T. b. gambiense. Although the functional significance of tryptophan catabolism to trypanosomatids remains obscure, the pathway is quantitatively significant in all species examined thus far."
513,Purification and characterization of phospho enol pyruvate carboxykinase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0167-4838(95)00061-x,1995-05-18,[],"ATP-dependent phospho enol pyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.49; PEPCK, ATP) was purified from glycosomes of cultured procyclic Trypanosoma brucei to electrophoretic homogeneity. The purified enzyme exhibited a mean specific activity of 83 units mg-1, as measured in the carboxylation direction at 30 degrees C. A similar activity was obtained for the decarboxylation reaction. The enzyme was shown to be a homodimer in solution with a subunit molecular mass of 59 kDa. Amino acid sequence analysis suggested that the PEPCK (ATP) is identical to the trypanosomal protein p60, the sequence of which was previously predicted from the corresponding nucleotide sequence by other investigators. The basic nature of the enzyme was indicated by a high isoelectric point (pH 8.9). The enzyme was found to be strictly dependent on adenosine nucleotides for activity, as well as on the presence of Mn2+. Mg2+ was found to be ineffective as activator of the trypanosomal enzyme, but a combination of subsaturating (< or = 300 microM) concentrations of Mn2+ and high concentrations of Mg2+ caused a synergistic effect on the carboxylation activity, indicating a dual cation requirement. Mn2+ is necessary to activate the enzyme and Mn2+ or Mg2+ most likely forms the cation-nucleotide complex as the active form of the substrate. Relatively high (5 mM) levels of ATP were required to produce a significant inhibition of the carboxylation reaction. Quinolinic acid, a structural analogue of oxaloacetate, completely inhibited the decarboxylation reaction at a 1 mM concentration. The apparent Michaelis constants of the enzyme were 490 microM for PEP, 37 microM for oxaloacetate, 40 microM for ADP, 10.3 microM for ATP, 970 microM for Mn2+ and 26 mM for HCO3-. Endogenous substrate concentrations were found to be 327 nmol PEP, 1486 nmol ADP, 4200 nmol ATP and 11.5 nmol Mn2+ (ml cell volume)-1. Our kinetic data suggest that under physiological conditions PEPCK (ATP) in T. brucei is bidirectional and that its activity is regulated primarily by mass action. The physiological relevance of the enzyme in procyclic T. brucei is discussed."

Comparison of the sequence with those of pyruvate kinases from members of the family Trypanosomatidae revealed amino acid identities of 58.4-61.5%, and, to some extent, conservation of residues supposed to be involved in the binding of the allosteric effector fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Some kinetic properties of Trypanoplasma borelli pyruvate kinase have been determined and appear to be similar to those of the enzyme from Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania mexicana."

Its amino-acid sequence is 73.7% identical to that of the Trypanosoma brucei PYK and 46.4-49.8% to the enzyme of mammalian cells. The second gene appears not to be functional, because its 5' and 3' extremities have undergone recombinations. L. m. mexicana PYK has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, using a T7 expression system. Approximately 30% of the protein was detected in the soluble cell fraction. It has been highly purified by chromatography over DEAE-Sephacel and Affigel Blue. From a 1-1 culture 6 mg enzyme was obtained with a specific activity of 224 units mg-1. The protein has a subunit molecular mass of 59,000, as determined by SDS/PAGE, and an isoelectric point of 5.9. Some kinetic properties of the enzyme have been measured and compared with those reported for the T. brucei enzyme. The kinetics of both enzymes are very similar, the most important aspect being their activation by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Nevertheless, some differences were observed; the T. brucei enzyme is activated by the effector in a cooperative manner, whereas the activation of the L. m. mexicana enzyme is not cooperative."
521,The involvement of inositol phosphoglycan mediators in the modulation of steroidogenesis by insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I.,10.1210/endo.132.4.8462454,1993-04-01,[],"We have investigated the mechanisms by which insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) regulate the synthesis of progesterone by swine ovary granulosa cells. Analysis of the cell density dependence of the effects of insulin and IGF-I showed that the induction of progesterone synthesis by these growth factors is consistent with an autocrine or paracrine model of action, which involves the insulin- and IGF-I-stimulated release of a soluble factor(s) into the culture medium. We have tested the hypothesis that this soluble factor(s) may be structurally related to inositol phosphoglycans, a class of putative second messengers of the action of insulin. Consistent with this hypothesis, we isolated an activator of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphatase from culture medium obtained from cells treated with insulin or IGF-I. Further analysis showed that specific antibodies raised against the inositol phosphoglycan anchor of the variant surface glycoprotein of Trypanosoma brucei blocked the activation of PDH phosphatase by the material isolated from the culture medium, suggesting a close structural relationship between this putative PDH phosphatase activator and inositol phosphaglycans. Pertussis toxin treatment, shown to inhibit the generation of inositol phosphoglycans in other systems, was found to inhibit the effects of insulin on progesterone synthesis in granulosa cells. Finally, the stimulatory effects of insulin and IGF-I on progesterone synthesis by intact granulosa cells were markedly inhibited by the addition of antiinositol phosphoglycan antibodies to the culture medium. Based on these observations, we propose that the release of inositol phosphoglycans into the extracellular medium plays an important role in the signaling mechanisms by which insulin and IGF-I regulate the synthesis of progesterone in swine ovary granulosa cells."

At the acute phase, three days after inoculation, the animals were sacrificed for estimating the serum levels of LH and testosterone and the number of testicular LH receptors. Considering a possible intervention of the stress during the infestation and to improve our investigations on gonadal imbalance related to trypanosomasis, levels of additional parameters [corticosterone, glucose and transaminases (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase)] were determined. Stimulation testing with hCG was likewise assessed in infested rats to analyse the testicular testosterone response to gonadotropin. A significant decrease was demonstrated for serum LH and testosterone levels in the infested rats, as well as the loss of: (i) the testicular responsiveness to exogenous gonadotropin; (ii) the number of testicular LH receptors. Moreover, the remaining testicular receptors of infested rats showed an increase in their equilibrium association constant (Ka). Our study suggests that dysfunction of Leydig cells occurring during African trypanosomiasis is in part related to stress induced by the presence of the parasites."

We present evidence for the existence of a facilitated diffusion carrier in the plasma membrane of T. brucei which specifically mediates the translocation of pyruvate. The uptake of pyruvate followed saturation kinetics (Km 1.96 +/- 0.28 mM; Cmax 36.61 +/- 1.15 nmol pyruvate/30 sec.mg protein), after correction of the data for a nonsaturable diffusion component. The uptake of pyruvate was competitively inhibited by a number of (oxo)monocarboxylic acids, including pyruvate analogs and metabolically related substances, but not by L-lactate. The transport exhibited the phenomenon of transacceleration, indicative for the involvement of a facilitated diffusion carrier. The carrier is highly specific for pyruvate and differs from other known monocarboxylate carriers present in the mitochondrial and/or plasma membrane of other eukaryotic cells in that it does not transport L-lactate."

Reagent incorporation was completely protected by the presence of ADP plus MnCl2. The labeled protein was digested with trypsin after carboxymethylation. Two labeled peptides were isolated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and were sequenced by gas-phase automatic Edman degradation. Both peptides contained overlapping amino acid sequences from Asn-358 to Lys-375, thus identifying Cys-364 as the reactive amino acid residue.

531,Some kinetic properties of pyruvate kinase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(92)90220-e,1992-02-01,[],"We have studied the kinetics of the allosteric interactions of pyruvate kinase from Trypanosoma brucei. The kinetics for phosphoenolpyruvate depended strongly on the nature of the bivalent metal ions. Pyruvate kinase activated by Mg2+ had the highest catalytic activity, but also the highest S0.5 for phosphoenolpyruvate, while the opposite was true for pyruvate kinase activated by Mn2+. The reaction rates of Mg(2+)-pyruvate kinase and Mn(2+)-pyruvate kinase were clearly allosteric with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate, while the kinetics with Co(2+)-pyruvate kinase were hyperbolic. However, Co(2+)-pyruvate kinase was still sensitive to heterotropic activation. Trypanosomal pyruvate kinase is unique in that the best activator was fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate and 5-phosphorylribose 1-pyrophosphate were also strong heterotropic activators, which were much more effective than fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. In the presence of the heterotropic activators, the sigmoidal kinetics with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate and the bivalent metal ions were modified as were the concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate and the bivalent metal ions needed to attain the maximal activity. Maximal activities were not significantly changed with Mg2+ and Mn2+ as the activating metal ions. Moreover, with Co2+ and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate or ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate or 5-phosphorylribose 1-pyrophosphate, the maximal activity was significantly reduced. Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate and 5-phosphorylribose 1-pyrophosphate resembled fructose 2,6-bisphosphate rather than fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate in their action in that the K0.5 values for the former 3 compounds increased when Mg2+ was replaced by Co2+, while the K0.5 for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
533,Molecular cloning and analysis of two tandemly linked genes for pyruvate kinase of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb21043.x,1991-08-15,[],"In Trypanosoma brucei (stock 427) genes encoding the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase are present on two homologous chromosomes. We have cloned and characterized one of the alleles. Two large, tandemly arranged open reading frames were found, each coding for a pyruvate kinase polypeptide of 498 amino acids. The gene sequences differ at 15 positions, resulting in five amino acid substitutions. The calculated molecular masses of the polypeptides are 54,378 Da and 54,363 Da. These values are somewhat smaller than those reported for the subunit molecular mass of the purified protein, which is 57-59 kDa. However, in vitro translation of the DNA region corresponding to the open reading frame, and translation of the RNA in a wheat-germ lysate, yielded a product that comigrated exactly with the native polypeptide in SDS/PAGE. The overall identity between the sequences of the trypanosomal enzyme and the enzymes from other sources is 41-51%. The conserved residues are not equally distributed over the polypeptide. The primary structure of domains A and, to a lesser extent, B, which constitute the active site, are rather well conserved. In contrast, the sequence of domain C, which supposedly is involved in the regulation of the enzyme activity, is much more variable. The cytosolically located pyruvate kinase of T. brucei lacks the specific features found in the majority of the glycolytic enzymes of this organism that are sequestered in a microbody-like organelle, the glycosome. It has neither a relatively high subunit molecular mass, due to unique insertions or terminal extensions, nor a high excess of positively charged amino acids. The polypeptide is shorter than that of most other pyruvate kinases and the calculated net charge is only +3."

Trypanosomes from continuous culture were exposed to series of drug dilutions in a microtiter plate. After an incubation time of 72 h at 37 degrees C, the pH indicator of the medium had changed its colour in non-inhibited cultures due to the production of pyruvate. Inhibited cultures showed less, if any, colour changes. Plates could be read by eye or using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader. Within the pH range of 7.0-7.5, the extinction values of phenol red at 560 nm showed a linear correlation with both the pH of the medium and the pyruvate concentration in the medium. By comparison of the decreases in extinction in test cultures with those in control cultures, IC50 values (drug concentrations causing 50% inhibition) could be determined. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) could be read by eye. The photometric test evaluation was compared with evaluation according to growth inhibition or to incorporation of radiolabelled hypoxanthine. The three methods of evaluation gave similar results."

These antibodies (i) block the in vitro effects of purified insulin mediators and (ii) block the insulin-induced stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase in intact BC3H1 myocytes but not insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, generation of diacylglycerol, or generation of insulin mediators. When added to intact cells in the presence of insulin, these antibodies induce the accumulation of insulin mediator activity in the extracellular medium. We therefore conclude that these anti-inositolglycan antibodies block some of the effects of insulin by inhibiting the uptake of specific insulin mediators generated outside the cell."
542,Purification in a single step and kinetic characterization of the pyruvate kinase of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(88)90165-x,1988-11-01,[],"The pyruvate kinase of Trypanosoma brucei can be purified to homogeneity in one step by affinity elution from a phosphocellulose column with the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and the allosteric activator fructose-2,6-diphosphate (FDP). The purified enzyme has a specific activity of 175 mumol min-1 (mg protein)-1 and a subunit molecular mass of 59 kDa as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Kinetic studies of the pure enzyme show that an increase in the PEP concentration decreases the apparent Km for adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and that an increase in the ADP concentration decreases the half saturation point (S0.5) for PEP. Likewise, the allosteric activator FDP decreases both the apparent Km for ADP and the S0.5 for PEP. ADP concentrations above 0.2 mM inhibit trypanosomal pyruvate kinase."
544,Further biochemical characterization of chronic Trypanosoma brucei gambiense-Microtus montanus infection.,10.4269/ajtmh.1987.37.314,1987-09-01,[],"Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured in the serum and livers of Microtus montanus infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Only liver TAT and serum ALP showed significant changes. In addition, blood glucose, pyruvate and lactate, and liver glycogen levels were assayed. All four compounds showed significant changes, strongly suggesting increased glycogen mobilization and increased catabolic activity. Interestingly, the serum ketone levels were very low and no significant changes were observed. These chronically infected animals had an organic aciduria in which pyruvate, lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, phenylpyruvate, and p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate were significantly increased. The possible significance of these observations is discussed."

Phosphate and arsenate had an effect opposite to that of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and the apparent Ka for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was shifted from 75 nM to 1.5 microM by the presence of 5 mM phosphate. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate had effects similar to those of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate but at approximately 4000-fold higher concentrations. Pyruvate kinases of Crithidia luciliae and of Leishmania major, two trypanosomatids which are like T. brucei in containing glycosomes, were also stimulated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and inhibited by phosphate."
549,Cysteine eliminates the feeder cell requirement for cultivation of Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms in vitro.,10.1084/jem.162.4.1256,1985-10-01,[],"In all previous studies, bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei could be grown in vitro only when supported by a feeder layer of mammalian fibroblasts. We have axenically cultivated bloodstream T. brucei by adding L-cysteine at regular intervals and appropriate concentrations. The optimum cysteine concentration depends on cell density and is close to physiological serum levels. At concentrations greater than 24 mg/liter (2 X 10(-4) M), cysteine was acutely toxic to trypanosome concentrations of 3 X 10(7)/ml. Toxicity was prevented by addition of pyruvate or catalase, which neutralize H2O2 produced by cysteine autoxidation. In uptake studies using [35S]cysteine and [35S]cystine, T. brucei efficiently incorporated only cysteine. The Km for cysteine uptake was 4 X 10(-4) M. Cystine supported axenic growth if low concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol were added at regular intervals."

Out of 14 different strains tested, 10 could be cultured including Trypanosoma brucei, T. equiperdum, T. evansi, T. rhodesiense and T. gambiense. The presence of a reducing agent (2-mercaptoethanol or thioglycerol) was found to be essential for growth. The standard medium consisted of Hepes buffered minimum essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 0.2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM pyruvate and 10% inactivated serum either from rabbit (T. brucei, T. equiperdum, T. evansi and T. rhodesiense) or human (T. gambiense). Although a general medium could be defined for the long-term maintenance of trypanosome cultures, the initiation to culture nevertheless required particular conditions for the different strains. The cultured trypanosomes had all the characteristics of the in vivo bloodstream forms including: morphology, infectivity, antigenic variation and glucose metabolism."
552,Multiple alpha-keto aciduria in Microtus montanus chronically infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense.,10.1016/0305-0491(85)90130-0,1985-01-01,[],"Microtus montanus chronically infected with a monomorphic strain of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense excreted in urine greatly elevated quantities of not only the aromatic alpha-keto acids, phenylpyruvic and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acids, but also two aliphatic alpha-keto acids, pyruvic and alpha-ketoglutaric acids. Elevated keto acid excretion began approximately midway through infection and quantities remained elevated until death. Daily keto acid excretion did not correlate with daily parasitemia. Thus, a large metabolic disturbance exists in laboratory animals infected with African trypanosomes. The multiple alpha-keto aciduria potentially contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic African trypanosomiasis."
554,Pyruvate kinase: a carnitine-regulated site of ATP production in Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1016/0305-0491(84)90104-4,1984-01-01,[],"Pyruvate kinase activity in Trypanosoma brucei brucei is stimulated in the presence of L-carnitine and is inhibited by acetyl CoA, ATP or the ATP-Mg2+ complex. Increased pyruvate kinase activity is associated with stimulation of ATP synthesis in the presence of L-carnitine. There is evidence that carnitine stimulates pyruvate kinase activity indirectly by removing the inhibitory modulator acetyl CoA as a result of the carnitine acetyl transferase (CAT) also present in the trypanosomes."
555,Increased urinary excretion of aromatic amino acid catabolites by Microtus montanus chronically infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense.,10.1016/0305-0491(84)90309-2,1984-01-01,[],"Microtus montanus infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense for 16 and 21 days excreted significantly greater quantities of several aromatic amino acid catabolites when compared to uninfected control animals. Very large quantities of three aromatic alpha-keto acids (alpha-oxocarboxylic acids), phenylpyruvic acid, 4- hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid and indole-3-pyruvic acid, were excreted by infected animals. Increased excretion of indole-3-lactic acid and indole-3-acetic acid was also detected. Gas chromatographic-mass spectral analysis of the trimethylsilyl derivatives of phenylpyruvic acid, 4- hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid and indole-3-pyruvic acid confirms the identity of the aromatic alpha-keto acids elevated during infection. The marked alpha-keto aciduria indicates that a large disturbance exists in aromatic amino acid metabolism in this chronic animal model of African trypanosomiasis. The disturbance may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. The increased catabolite concentrations may also prove to be useful diagnostically and prognostically."
561,Phenylalanine metabolism in Microtus montanus chronically infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense.,10.1016/0305-0491(82)90242-5,1982-01-01,[],"1. Alterations in phenylalanine metabolism were observed in Microtus montanus infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. 2. Reductions were found in the incorporation of phenylalanine into free amino acid pools and into proteins of the liver and other organs of infected animals. 3. Increased quantities of phenylpyruvate, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and pyruvate were found in the urine of infected Microtus. 4. There appeared to be very limited conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine in infected animals. This suggested that either phenylalanine transaminase activity was greatly elevated in proportion to phenylalanine hydroxylase activity; or that phenylalanine hydroxylase activity was actually reduced during the infection."

The Km for the coenzyme ADP is pH-dependent and shows the involvement of a dissociable group on the free enzyme with a pKa of 6.5-6.7. The cooperative interaction of the multiple phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) binding sites is independent of pH in the range of 5.7-7.8. Variation of the Vmax value with pH indicates the presence of a dissociated group (pKa 6.2-6.3) and of an undissociated group (pKa 7.5-7.6) in the enzyme-substrate complex. A doubly dissociated phosphate group on PEP is shown to be essential by the effects of pH on the S0.5 value for this substrate, as is an undissociated enzyme group with a pKa in the range 6.7-7.0. It is shown that PEP and frucotse-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) act entirely in conjunction in allosterically activating the enzyme, FDP, the heterotropic effector, decreases the interaction between PEP binding sites at low concentration, and decreases the S0.5 value for PEP at higher concentration. A model for the interaction of the enzyme with its substrates is discussed."
564,Inhibition of NADP-linked malic enzyme from Onchocerca volvulus and Dirofilaria immitis by suramin.,10.1016/0166-6851(81)90028-1,1981-11-01,[],"NADP-linked malic enzyme (malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) NADP+, EC 1.1.1.40) has been partially purified from adult Onchocerca volvulus and Dirofilaria immitis. Suramin was found to inhibit the activity of malic enzyme from both filarial worms. The inhibition constants for suramin were calculated to be 0.011 microM and 0.015 microM for the enzymes from O. volvulus and D. immitis, respectively. In the case of NADP-linked malic enzyme from Trypanosoma brucei and chicken liver the inhibition by suramin was less pronounced. The inhibition constants were found to be 0.8 microM and 2.5 microM for the protozoan and vertebrate enzymes, respectively. The type of inhibition was competitive with respect to malate. The Michaelis constants for malate and pyruvate were determined to be 0.9 and 4.5 mM for O. volvulus and 0.85 and 5.0 mM for D. immitis, respectively. The low Km values for malate compared to those for pyruvate and the about 15-fold greater turnover in the direction of decarboxylation compared to carboxylation indicated that malic enzyme from both filarial sources might be involved in an alternative pathway leading from phosphoenolpyruvate via oxaleacetate, malate and pyruvate to lactate. It is suggested, that the inhibition of malic enzyme activity from O. volvulus by suramin might interfere with the generation of NADPH for biosynthetic reactions."
576,Utilization of amino acids by Trypanosoma brucei in culture: L-threonine as a precursor for acetate.,10.1017/s0031182000046758,1975-10-01,[],"The amino acid compositions of several culture media have been analysed and compared. The utilization and excretion of amino acids and other metabolites have been followed during growth of Trypanosoma brucei S42 in a defined medium. All of the added L-threonine was metabolized by the cells, even when it was present at elevated concentrations. Glucose was consumed throughout the growth cycle: glutamine was consumed more rapidly than glutamic acid, which was itself used at about the same rate as proline. Threonine was cleaved to form glycine and acetate, both of which accumulated in the medium. Alanine and succinate were excreted together with a small amount of pyruvate, but these three products accounted for less than half of the glucose used. CO2 production from glucose was not measured, but insignificant amounts of CO2 were produced from threonine. Tetraethylthiuram disulphide blocked the cleavage of threonine and was a potent inhibitor of trypanosome growth."
577,Carbon dioxide fixation in trypanosomatids.,10.1017/s003118200005318x,1975-08-01,[],"Fixation of carbon dioxide has been demonstrated for extracts from Crithidia fasciculata, Trypanosoma mega and Trypanosoma brucei brucei bloodstream and culture forms. The enzymes involved in this fixation were found to be ADP-stimulated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (E.C. 4.1.1.32), 'malic' enzyme (E.C. 1.1.138-40) and pyruvate carboxylase (E.C. 6.4.1.1). The subcellular localization of these enzymes has been investigated in all three organisms. Products of short and long term fixation experiments were separated and identified. The importance of carboxylation reactions is discussed in relation to the maintenance of oxidized and reduced coenzyme levels."
585,Cytosolic NADPH homeostasis in glucose-starved procyclic Trypanosoma brucei relies on malic enzyme and the pentose phosphate pathway fed by gluconeogenic flux.,10.1074/jbc.M113.462978,2013-05-15,"['Gluconeogenesis', 'NADPH Production', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Redox Regulation', 'Transhydrogenase-like Shunt', 'Trypanosoma brucei', 'Trypanosome']","All living organisms depend on NADPH production to feed essential biosyntheses and for oxidative stress defense. Protozoan parasites such as the sleeping sickness pathogen Trypanosoma brucei adapt to different host environments, carbon sources, and oxidative stresses during their infectious life cycle. The procyclic stage develops in the midgut of the tsetse insect vector, where they rely on proline as carbon source, although they prefer glucose when grown in rich media. Here, we investigate the flexible and carbon source-dependent use of NADPH synthesis pathways in the cytosol of the procyclic stage. The T. brucei genome encodes two cytosolic NADPH-producing pathways, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the NADP-dependent malic enzyme (MEc). Reverse genetic blocking of those pathways and a specific inhibitor (dehydroepiandrosterone) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase together established redundancy with respect to H2O2 stress management and parasite growth. Blocking both pathways resulted in ∼10-fold increase of susceptibility to H2O2 stress and cell death. Unexpectedly, the same pathway redundancy was observed in glucose-rich and glucose-depleted conditions, suggesting that gluconeogenesis can feed the PPP to provide NADPH. This was confirmed by (i) a lethal phenotype of RNAi-mediated depletion of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (PGI) in the glucose-depleted Δmec/Δmec null background, (ii) an ∼10-fold increase of susceptibility to H2O2 stress observed for the Δmec/Δmec/(RNAi)PGI double mutant when compared with the single mutants, and (iii) the (13)C enrichment of glycolytic and PPP intermediates from cells incubated with [U-(13)C]proline, in the absence of glucose. Gluconeogenesis-supported NADPH supply may also be important for nucleotide and glycoconjugate syntheses in the insect host."
586,Crystal structure of phosphoglucose isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei complexed with glucose-6-phosphate at 1.6 A resolution.,10.1002/prot.22133,2008-06-19,[],"Enzymes of glycolysis in Trypanosoma brucei have been identified as potential drug targets for African sleeping sickness because glycolysis is the only source of ATP for the bloodstream form of this parasite. Several inhibitors were previously reported to bind preferentially to trypanosomal phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI, the second enzyme in glycolysis) than to mammalian PGIs, which suggests that PGI might make a good target for species-specific drug design. Herein, we report recombinant expression, purification, crystallization and X-ray crystal structure determination of T. brucei PGI. One structure solved at 1.6 A resolution contains a substrate, D-glucose-6-phosphate, in an extended conformation in the active site. A second structure solved at 1.9 A resolution contains a citrate molecule in the active site. The structures are compared with the crystal structures of PGI from humans and from Leishmania mexicana. The availability of recombinant tPGI and its first high-resolution crystal structures are initial steps in considering this enzyme as a potential drug target."

The unicellular protozoans, Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi and Leishmania spp., of the order Kinetoplastida are important human parasites responsible for African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease and leishmaniases, respectively. In these parasites, glycolysis is an important (and in some cases the only) metabolic pathway for ATP supply. The first seven of the 10 enzymes that participate in glycolysis, as well as an important fraction of the enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway, are compartmentalized in peroxisome-like organelles called glycosomes. The dependence of the parasites on glycolysis, the importance of the pentose phosphate pathway in defense against oxidative stress, and the unique compartmentalization of these pathways, point to the enzymes contained in the glycosome as potential targets for drug design. The present report describes the first crystallographic structure of a parasite (Leishmania mexicana) glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. A comparison of the atomic structure of L. mexicana, human and other mammalian PGIs, which highlights unique features of the parasite's enzyme, is presented."
588,Trypanosoma brucei infection induces apoptosis and up-regulates neuroleukin expression in the cerebellum.,10.1080/00034980120111145,2002-01-11,[],"Human infection with Trypanosoma brucei may result in meningo-encephalitis, neuronal demyelination, blood-brain-barrier dysfunction, peri-vascular infiltration, astrocytosis and neuronal apoptosis. Prevention of the short- or long-term, parasite-induced, neuronal assault requires a better understanding of the host's responses to the infection at the molecular level. Northern analysis, cDNA micro-arrays, reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), SDS-PAGE and immunohistology were therefore used to investigate global gene and protein expression in the brains of mice infected with T. brucei. Temporal and spatial expression of neuroleukin (NLK), a predominant neurotrophin which is associated with neuronal protection and regeneration during neuronal assault in the brain, was then assessed. Expression of 20 of the 588 genes investigated (representing pro- and anti-inflammatory immuno-modulators, growth factors, neurotransmitters, and pro- and anti-apoptosis factors) was significantly altered (P < 0.05). TUNEL analysis revealed extensive apoptosis at peak parasitaemia, mainly in the cerebellum. RT-PCR analysis of two regulators of apoptosis, Bcl-x(L) (anti-apoptotic) and Bax (pro-apoptotic), revealed equivalent increases in levels of expression. NLK expression was up-regulated in punctated fashion in brain and was mainly localized to abnormal (stellate) catecholamine neurons (CN) in the locus coeruleus (LC) of infected [and, to a lesser degree, the normal (polygonal) cells of uninfected] brainstem. Expression of NLK receptor (NLK-R) was inversely correlated with that of NLK. At peak parasitaemia, trypanosome infection apparently induces cerebellar apoptosis and a corresponding increase in NLK expression. NLK may be modulating inflammation and is probably involved in protecting CN and the cerebellum against apoptosis."
589,Transcriptome meets metabolome: hierarchical and metabolic regulation of the glycolytic pathway.,10.1016/s0014-5793(01)02613-8,2001-07-11,[],"The fact that information flows from DNA to RNA to protein to function suggests that regulation is 'hierarchical', i.e. dominated by regulation of gene expression. In the case of dominant regulation at the metabolic level, however, there is no quantitative relationship between mRNA levels and function. We here develop a method to quantitate the relative contributions of metabolic and hierarchical regulation. Applying this method to the glycolytic flux in three species of parasitic protists, we conclude that it is rarely regulated by gene expression alone. This casts strong doubts on whether transcriptome and proteome analysis suffices to assess biological function."

For comparison, the inhibitory properties of the corresponding non-phosphorylated analogues D-arabinonhydroxamic acid, D-arabinonate, D-arabinonamide and D-arabinonhydrazide were also evaluated. D-Arabinonhydroxamic acid-5-phosphate appears as the most potent competitive inhibitor ever evaluated on a phosphoglucose isomerase with an inhibition constant value of 50 nM and a Michaelis constant over inhibition constant ratio of about 2000. Our results show that anionic high energy intermediate analogues, and more particularly D-arabinonhydroxamic acid-5-phosphate, display a weak but significant specificity for Trypanosoma brucei phosphoglucose isomerase versus yeast phosphoglucose isomerase, while neutral high energy intermediate analogues are not selective at all. This would indicate the presence of more positively charged residues in the active site for Trypanosoma brucei phosphoglucose isomerase as compared to that of yeast phosphoglucose isomerase."
591,Biological and biochemical characterization of isolates of Trypanosoma evansi from Pantanal of Matogrosso--Brazil.,10.1016/s0304-4017(00)00286-7,2000-08-18,[],"Ten isolates of Trypanosoma evansi from the Pantanal region of Brazil, recently derived from coati (Nasua nasua, carnivora, Procyonidae), horses and dogs, were characterized on the basis of biological (experimental infections in Wistar rats) and biochemical (multilocus enzyme eletrophoresis) data. Biological data were analyzed by Nested analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis. Marked heterogeneity in virulence was observed in the isolates. Some of the isolates showed an undulating parasitaemia, typical for African trypanosomes. This biological heterogeneity did not correspond with the biochemical homogeneity observed in the T. evansi isolates. T. evansi has one of the widest distributions and greatest range of mammalian hosts and is widely recognized to have evolved from Trypanosoma brucei. Adaptability of T. evansi was not reflected in the variability of biochemical and molecular parameters studied to date. The variability in virulence was very significant, but not correlated with the host from which it was derived. These data suggested that, in the region studied, T. evansi is transmitted among both domestic and sylvatic animals in one single transmission cycle."
592,Purification and properties of phosphoglucose isomerases of Trypanosoma cruzi.,10.1016/s0305-0491(99)00002-4,1999-05-18,[],"Glucosephosphate isomerase (PGI; EC 5.3.1.9) of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes was found in about the same proportion in the glycosome and the cytosol. This subcellular distribution is similar to that of Leishmania mexicana, but contrasts with that of T. brucei bloodstream form, where the enzyme is essentially restricted to the glycosome. Glucosephosphate isomerase was highly purified from a glycosome-enriched fraction and to about 70% purity from the soluble extract. Both enzymes displayed Michaelis-Menten-Henri kinetics. Km values for fructose 6-phosphate were 0.125 +/- 0.07 and 0.80 +/- 0.10 mM for the glycosomal and the cytosolic PGIs, respectively. Erythrose-4-phosphate, 6-phosphogluconate and mannose-6-phosphate were inhibitors for both PGIs. Phosphogluconate and erythrose phosphate showed higher affinity for cytosolic PGI than for glycosomal PGI, by 2.5- and 4-fold respectively. The PGIs differed slightly in their isoelectric point (7.1 +/- 0.15 and 7.5 +/- 0.12) and optimum pH range. Both PGIs also differed in their chromatographic properties (ion-exchange and phenyl Sepharose), indicating a difference in charge and hydrophobicity, with the glycosomal enzyme being more hydrophobic. The molecular mass of both PGIs was 186,000 +/- 9000 Da, which is higher than that of other known PGIs, including those from T. brucei and other trypanosomatids. The molecular mass of the subunit, 63 kDa, is similar to that of PGIs from other sources. It appears that PGIs from T. cruzi are trimeric, in contrast with all other known PGIs which are dimeric."
594,Subcellular distribution and characterization of glucosephosphate isomerase in Leishmania mexicana mexicana.,10.1016/0166-6851(94)00139-1,1994-10-01,[],"The glycolytic enzyme glucosephosphate isomerase (PGI) is present in two different cell compartments of Leishmania mexicana promastigotes; more than 90% of the activity was detected in the cytosol, the remainder in glycosomes. This subcellular distribution contrasts with that in Trypanosoma brucei, in which the enzyme activity has been mainly located in the glycosomes. PGI was partially purified from L. mexicana cell extracts. Throughout the purification procedure only one single PGI activity could be detected. The partially purified protein had the same subunit molecular mass (65 kDa) as the previously characterized glycosomal protein of T. brucei. Both proteins were also very similar with respect to their kinetic and antigenic properties. Using the T. brucei glycosomal PGI gene as a hybridization probe, we cloned the corresponding gene of L. mexicana. Only a single PGI locus could be detected in the L. mexicana genome. Characterization of the cloned gene showed that it codes for a polypeptide of 604 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 67,113. The sequences of the Leishmania and Trypanosoma polypeptides are 69% identical. They differ in calculated net charge (-8 versus -2, respectively) and isoelectric point (6.65 versus 7.35). Our data strongly suggest that the PGI activity in the two cell compartments of L. mexicana and T. brucei is not attributable to different isoenzymes. We discuss the possible metabolic function of the highly different enzyme distribution in the two organisms, and the molecular mechanism that could be responsible for it."
596,Genetic characterization of six parasitic protozoa: parity between random-primer DNA typing and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis.,10.1073/pnas.90.4.1335,1993-02-15,[],"We have assayed genetic polymorphisms in several species of parasitic protozoa by means of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). One goal was to ascertain the suitability of RAPD markers for investigating genetic and evolutionary problems, particularly in organisms, such as the parasitic protozoa, unsuitable for traditional methods of genetic analysis. Another goal was to test certain hypotheses concerning Trypanosoma cruzi, and other protozoa, that have been established by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. The RAPD results corroborate the hypothesis that the population structure of T. cruzi is clonal and yield a phylogeny of the clonal lineages in agreement with the one obtained by enzyme electrophoresis. This parity between the two sets of results confirms that RAPD markers are reliable genetic markers. The RAPD markers are also suitable for reconstructing species phylogenies and as diagnostic characters of species and subspecific lineages. The number of DNA polymorphisms that can be detected by the RAPD method seems virtually unlimited, since the number of primers can be increased effectively at will. The RAPD method is well suited for investigating genetic and evolutionary questions in certain organisms, because it is cost effective and demands no previous genetic knowledge about the organism."
597,Glucosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei. Cloning and characterization of the gene and analysis of the enzyme.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb15038.x,1989-09-15,[],"In Trypanosoma brucei the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, like most other enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, resides in a microbody-like organelle, the glycosome. Here we report a detailed study of this enzyme, involving a determination of its kinetic properties and the cloning and sequence analysis of its gene. The gene codes for a polypeptide of 606 amino acids, with a calculated Mr of 67280. The protein predicted from the gene sequence has 54-58% positional identity with its yeast and mammalian counterparts. Compared to those other glucose-6-phosphate isomerases the trypanosomal enzyme contains an additional 38-49 amino acids in its N-terminal domain, as well as a number of small insertions and deletions. The additional amino acids are responsible for the 5-kDa-larger subunit mass of the T. brucei enzyme, as measured by gel electrophoresis. The glucose-6-phosphate isomerase of the trypanosome has no excess of positive residues and, consequently, no high isoelectric point, in contrast to the other glycolytic enzymes that are present in the glycosome. However, similar to other glycosomal proteins analyzed so far, specific clusters of positive residues can be recognized in the primary structure. Comparison of the kinetic properties of the T. brucei glucose-6-phosphate isomerase with those of the yeast and rabbit muscle enzymes did not reveal major differences. The three enzymes have very similar pH profiles. The affinity for the substrate fructose 6-phosphate (Km = 0.122 mM) and the inhibition constant for the competitive inhibitor gluconate 6-phosphate (Ki = 0.14 mM) are in the same range as those of the similar enzymes. The Km shows the same strong dependence on salt as the rabbit muscle enzyme, although somewhat less than the yeast glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. The trypanocidal drug suramin inhibits the T. brucei and yeast enzymes to the same extent (Ki = 0.29 and 0.36 mM, respectively), but it had no effect on the rabbit muscle enzyme. Agaricic acid, a potent inhibitor of various glycosomal enzymes of T. brucei, has also a strong, irreversible effect on glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, while leaving the yeast and mammalian enzymes relatively unaffected."
601,Absence of substrate channeling in the glycosome of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(86)90059-9,1986-04-01,[],"Glycolytic enzymes in the purified glycosomes of Trypanosoma brucei brucei bloodstream forms were crosslinked to form a large protein complex by the bifunctional reagent dimethyl suberimidate [Aman, R.A., Kenyon, G.L. and Wang, C.C. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6966-6973]. The crosslinked enzyme complex was found capable of catalyzing the chain reactions leading from glucose to the formation of alpha-glycerophosphate in the presence of ATP and NADH. To determine whether the crosslinked enzyme complex exhibits multiple substrate channelings, these chain reactions were investigated in the crosslinked complex as well as in a preparation of solubilized native glycosomes. When glucose was present at a relatively high concentration (20 mM), production of alpha-glycerophosphate by the crosslinked complex had no apparent lag phase whereas the free enzyme mixture did. However, when the glucose level was lower (0.5-5.0 mM) the difference between the two enzyme preparations disappeared, a lag phase was found in both cases. Formation of sugar phosphates from radiolabeled glucose, followed by high performance liquid chromatographic analysis, showed no significant difference in the diluting powers of exogenous, unlabeled sugar phosphates added to the crosslinked complex or free enzymes. Exogenous fructose 1,6-diphosphatase demonstrated the same effectiveness in disrupting the chain reactions catalyzed by the crosslinked complex and the free enzyme mixture. In situ generation of 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate from 2-deoxyglucose and ATP was observed in the crosslinked complex, but the product had no amplified inhibitory effect on the phosphoglucose isomerase activity in the complex. All results suggest an absence of substrate channelings among the glycolytic enzymes in the glycosome of T. b. brucei bloodstream form."
605,The electrophoretic mobilities and activities of eleven enzymes of bloodstream and culture forms of Trypanosoma brucei compared.,10.1016/0166-6851(80)90048-1,1980-10-01,[],"Eleven soluble enzymes in the supernatant of bloodstream Trypanosoma brucei were compared for electrophoretic mobility and activity with those of T. brucei cultures grown in 3 different media. All bands of each enzyme found in the bloodstream form were also present in the cultured material, but extra bands of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) (EC 1.1.1.37), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) (EC 2.6.1.1), and in 2 to 6 cultures of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD) (EC 1.1.1.42) were present in culture forms but not in bloodstream forms. An interfering enzyme, peculiar to cultured T. brucei, which reacted with 2-oxoglutarate and possibly a trace amount of ammonium ions, ran with the fast-moving ASAT bands. Threonine dehydrogenase activity, high in cultured trypanosomes irrespective of the medium used but low in bloodstream trypanosomes, was markedly lower in Trypanosoma evansi and a much passaged T. brucei 8/18. Glucosephosphate isomerase activity on the other hand was high in bloodstream and low in cultured trypanosomes. Glutamate dehydrogenase activity was too low to record reliably in bloodstream trypanosomes, but could be clearly detected in cultured forms. As the differences point to some changes in gene expression between the two forms, culture material is likely to replace trypanosomes from living animals for electrophoretic characterization only when considerable comparative work has been done."

The two trypanosome enzymes showed many similarities in kinetic properties, but differed from each other somewhat in thermal stability and in isoelectric point. 3. Both trypanosome enzymes differ from PGI's from other sources in having a higher Ki for the competitive inhibitor 6-phosphogluconate."

The parasite enters the blood via the bite of the tsetse fly where it is wholly reliant on glycolysis for the production of ATP. Glycolytic enzymes have been regarded as challenging drug targets because of their highly conserved active sites and phosphorylated substrates. We describe the development of novel small molecule allosteric inhibitors of trypanosome phosphofructokinase (PFK) that block the glycolytic pathway resulting in very fast parasite kill times with no inhibition of human PFKs. The compounds cross the blood brain barrier and single day oral dosing cures parasitaemia in a stage 1 animal model of human African trypanosomiasis. This study demonstrates that it is possible to target glycolysis and additionally shows how differences in allosteric mechanisms may allow the development of species-specific inhibitors to tackle a range of proliferative or infectious diseases."

The predicted amino acid sequence contains the C-terminal glycosome-targeting tripeptide SKL; this localisation was confirmed by immunofluorescence assays.

The active site of T. brucei PFK (which is strictly ATP-dependent but belongs to the PP(i)-dependent family by sequence similarities) is a chimera of the two types of PFK. In particular, the active site of T. brucei PFK possesses amino acid residues and structural features characteristic of both types of PFK. Conformational changes upon ATP binding are observed that include the opening of the active site to accommodate the two substrates, MgATP and fructose 6-phosphate, and a dramatic ordering of the C-terminal helices, which act like reaching arms to hold the tetramer together. These conformational transitions are fundamentally different from those of other ATP-dependent PFKs.

The structure reveals that two insertions (the 17-20 and 329-348 loops) that are characteristic of trypanosomatid PFKs, but absent from bacterial and mammalian ATP-dependent PFKs, are located within and adjacent to the active site, and are in positions to play important roles in the enzyme's mechanism. The 90 residue N-terminal extension forms a novel domain that includes an ""embracing arm"" across the subunit boundary to the symmetry-related subunit in the tetrameric enzyme. Comparisons with the PPi-dependent PFK from Borrelia burgdorferi show that several features thought to be characteristic of PPi-dependent PFKs are present in the trypanosome ATP-dependent PFK. These two enzymes are generally more similar to each other than to the bacterial or mammalian ATP-dependent PFKs. However, there are critical differences at the active site of PPi-dependent PFKs that are sufficient to prevent the binding of ATP. This crystal structure of a eukaryotic PFK has enabled us to propose a detailed model of human muscle PFK that shows active site and other differences that offer opportunities for structure-based drug discovery for the treatment of sleeping sickness and other diseases caused by the trypanosomatid family of protozoan parasites."

The yield was 15-20 mg of pure enzyme per litre of culture. M(r) was shown to be 55 585 by mass spectrometry. Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained by the hanging-drop method of vapour diffusion with sodium formate as the precipitating agent. Monoclinic crystals of the apoenzyme grew within one week, as did orthorhombic crystals of PFK in the presence of enzymic reaction products or an active-site inhibitor. Initial attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement with bacterial PFK structures as search models proved unrewarding, but a multiple-copy search with a polyalanine model was successful. In addition, heavy-atom soaking with platinum and mercury has yielded derivatives suitable for X-ray diffraction. A combination of the phase information from the molecular-replacement solution and the heavy-atom derivatives should allow structure solution of TbPFK. The availability of this first eukaryotic PFK structure will be of particular significance for structure-based drug design and will also provide important additional structural evidence for the allosteric control of PFK activity."

The predicted amino acid sequence contains a C-terminal tripeptide that conforms to an established signal for glycosome targeting. L. donovani PFK showed most sequence similarity to inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi)-dependent PFKs, despite being ATP-dependent. It thereby resembles PFKs from other Kinetoplastida such as Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanoplasma borreli (characterized in this study), and a PFK found in Entamoeba histolytica. It exhibited hyperbolic kinetics with respect to ATP whereas the binding of the other substrate, fructose 6-phosphate, showed slight positive cooperativity. PPi, even at high concentrations, did not have any effect. AMP acted as an activator of PFK, shifting its kinetics for fructose 6-phosphate from slightly sigmoid to hyperbolic, and increasing considerably the affinity for this substrate, whereas GDP did not have any effect. Modelling studies and site-directed mutagenesis were employed to shed light on the structural basis for the AMP effector specificity and on ATP/PPi specificity among PFKs."
632,Exploring the active site of Trypanosoma brucei phosphofructokinase by inhibition studies: specific irreversible inhibition.,10.1021/bi020082z,2002-08-07,[],"This work deals with the phosphofructokinase enzyme (PFK) of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Inhibitors which are analogues of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) derived from 2,5-anhydromannitol and therefore blocked in a closed conformation, both nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated, were designed. They provided information on this class of ATP-dependent PFK (structurally more similar to PPi-dependent PFKs revealing (i) an ordered mechanism, ATP binding first, inducing an essential conformational change to increase the affinity for F6P, and (ii) a rather hydrophobic environment at the ATP binding site. Nonphosphorylated mannitol derivatives bind at both the ATP and F6P binding sites, whereas the phosphorylated derivatives only bind at the ATP binding site. The inhibitors bearing an aromatic ring substituted at the meta position indicate a polar interaction with lysine 227, which is specific to T. brucei PFK and is replaced by a glycine in human PFK. This lysine can be irreversibly bound, leading to inhibition when an electrophilic carbon atom is beta to the meta position on the ring. This lysine was identified by site-directed mutagenesis. This first example of a specific irreversible inactivation of T. brucei PFK offers an opportunity to develop biologically active compounds against the sleeping sickness, the causative agent of which is the trypanosome."

When this methylotrophic bacterium is grown on one-carbon (C(1)) compounds (e.g., methanol), an ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (ATP-PFK) activity is specifically induced, completely replacing the PP(i)-PFK. The two A. methanolica PFK isoenzymes have very distinct functions, namely, in the metabolism of C(6) and C(1) carbon substrates. This is the first report providing biochemical evidence for the presence and physiological roles of PP(i)-PFK and ATP-PFK isoenzymes in a bacterium. The novel ATP-PFK enzyme was purified to homogeneity and characterized in detail at the biochemical and molecular levels. The A. methanolica ATP-PFK and PP(i)-PFK proteins possess a low level of amino acid sequence similarity (24%), clearly showing that the two proteins are not the result of a gene duplication event. PP(i)-PFK is closely related to other (putative) actinomycete PFK enzymes. Surprisingly, the A. methanolica ATP-PFK is most similar to ATP-PFK from the protozoon Trypanosoma brucei and PP(i)-PFK proteins from the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and Treponema pallidum, both spirochetes, very distinct from actinomycetes. The data thus suggest that A. methanolica obtained the ATP-PFK-encoding gene via a lateral gene transfer event."

One open reading frame (ORF) was completely sequenced and for two others the 5' half of the gene was determined. The sequences were highly similar. The complete ORF corresponded to a polypeptide of about 46 kDa. All the peptide sequences obtained were present in the derived sequences. The complete ORF was highly similar to that of other PFKs, primarily in its amino-terminal half. The T. vaginalis enzyme was most similar to PPi-PFK of the mitochondriate heterolobosean, Naegleria fowleri. Most of the residues shown or assumed to be involved in substrate binding in other PPi-PFKs were conserved in the T. vaginalis enzyme. Direct comparison and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed a significant divergence among PPi-PFKs and related enzymes, which can be assigned to at least four distantly related groups, three of which contain enzymes of protists. The separation of these groups is supported with a high percentage of bootstrap proportions. The short T. vaginalis PFK shares a most recent common ancestor with the enzyme from N. fowleri. This pair is clearly separated from a group comprising the long (>60-kDa) enzymes from Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica pfk2, the spirochaetes Borrelia burgdorferi and Trepomena pallidum, as well as the alpha- and beta-subunits of plant PPi-PFKs. The third group (""X"") containing protist sequences includes the glycosomal ATP-PFK of Trypanosoma brucei, E. histolytica pfk1, and a second sequence from B. burgdorferi. The fourth group (""Y"") comprises cyanobacterial and high-G + C, Gram-positive eubacterial sequences. The well-studied PPi-PFK of Propionibacterium freudenreichii is highly divergent and cannot be assigned to any of these groups. These four groups are well separated from typical ATP-PFKs, the phylogenetic analysis of which confirmed relationships established earlier. These findings indicate a complex history of a key step of glycolysis in protists with several early gene duplications and possible horizontal gene transfers."
639,The glycosomal ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase of Trypanosoma brucei must have evolved from an ancestral pyrophosphate-dependent enzyme.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.00698.x,1998-02-14,[],"Trypanosoma brucei contains an ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK), located in its glycosomes, which are peroxisome-like organelles sequestering the majority of its glycolytic enzymes. In this paper, we report the cloning and sequencing of the single-copy gene encoding this enzyme. Its amino-acid sequence is more similar to pyrophosphate (PPi)-dependent PFKs than to other ATP-dependent PFKs. A phylogenetic analysis suggests that the enzyme must have been derived from a PPi-dependent ancestral PFK, which changed its phospho-donor specificity during evolution. The enzyme is no longer capable of using PPi as phospho substrate, nor can it catalyze the reverse reaction as PPi-PFKs generally can. Moreover, the presence of a high pyrophosphatase activity in the cell renders it unlikely that PPi can function as free-energy source in present-day trypanosomes. It remains to be determined which mutations were responsible for the change in phospho-substrate specificity of the trypanosomatid PFK. As a result of its particular evolutionary history, the T. brucei PFK shows many structural differences, even at the active site, when compared with other ATP-dependent PFKs. These differences offer great potential for the structure-based design of trypanocidal drugs."
644,A program for the identification of steady-state processes in biological systems.,10.1016/0010-4809(88)90049-3,1988-08-01,[],A dedicated nonlinear regression program for the identification of steady-state processes is described in detail. Experimental data are fitted to the rational function which describes such systems. The algorithm makes use of parameter separation to relieve the user from the need to assign initial estimates to the linear parameters and to speed up the computation. A modified Marquardt algorithm is used and some properties of the function are exploited to improve the convergence rate and execution time. The search is made constrained by the addition of a penalty function to the residual sum of squares. Graphics are included to help the user find good initial estimates for the nonlinear parameters and as an aid to judge the goodness of fit of the result. Residual plots are also available to help the user identify the origin of the differences in the statistical tests. A final prediction error test is provided since this statistic is thought to be the most appropriate for the nonlinear function used. An enzyme kinetic example illustrates the procedure. The program was coded in Turbo Pascal on an IBM compatible PC.
645,The roles of magnesium ions in the reaction catalysed by phosphofructokinase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1042/bj2470041,1987-10-01,[],"The involvement of Mg2+ ions in the reaction catalysed by phosphofructokinase from Trypanosoma brucei was studied. The true substrate for the enzyme was shown to be the MgATP2-complex, and free Mg2+ ions are also required for enzyme activity. At concentrations of MgATP2- of 2.92 mM and greater, and a fructose 6-phosphate concentration of 1 mM and in the presence of EDTA as a Mg2+ buffer, the Km value for Mg2+ was determined to be 294 +/- 18 microM. Neither MgATP nor free ATP is an inhibitor of the enzyme, although apparent inhibition by the latter can be observed as a consequence of the decrease in free Mg2+ by chelation."
647,Kinetic studies on the reaction catalysed by phosphofructokinase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1042/bj2450013,1987-07-01,[],"The steady-state kinetics of the reaction catalysed by the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei were studied at pH 6.7. In the presence of 50 mM-potassium phosphate buffer, the apparent co-operativity with respect to fructose 6-phosphate and the non-linear relationship between initial velocity and enzyme concentration, which were found when the enzyme was assayed in 50 mM-imidazole buffer [Cronin & Tipton (1985) Biochem. J. 227, 113-124], are not evident. Studies on the variations of the initial rate with changing concentrations of MgATP and fructose 6-phosphate, the product inhibition by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and the effects of the alternative substrate ITP were consistent with an ordered reaction pathway, in which MgATP binds to the enzyme before fructose 6-phosphate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is the first product to dissociate from the ternary complex."
650,Purification and regulatory properties of phosphofructokinase from Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) brucei brucei.,10.1042/bj2270113,1985-04-01,[],"Phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) from Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) brucei brucei was purified to homogeneity by using a three-step procedure that may be performed within 1 day. Proteolysis, which removes a fragment of Mr approx. 2000, may occur during the purification, but this can be prevented by including antipain, an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases, in the buffers during the purification. The subunits of the enzyme appear to be identical in size, with an Mr of 49 000. The Mr of the native enzyme was estimated to be approx. 220 000, suggesting a tetrameric structure. Kinetic studies showed the activity to depend hyperbolically on the concentration of ATP but sigmoidally on the concentration of fructose 6-phosphate. Although cyclic AMP, AMP and ADP stimulated the enzyme activity at low concentrations of fructose 6-phosphate, the last two nucleotides were inhibitory at high concentrations of this substrate. Phosphoenolpyruvate behaved as an allosteric inhibitor of the phosphofructokinase. Citrate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and Pi did not influence significantly the activity of the enzyme."

This sphingolipid metabolite can be degraded by the action of sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (SPL) to form hexadecenal and ethanolamine phosphate. The importance of SPL-mediated ethanolamine phosphate formation has been characterized in only few cell types. We show that in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, expression of TbSpl is essential for cell survival. Ablation of TbSpl expression increased sphingosine-1-phosphate levels and reduced de novo formation and steady-state levels of the glycerophospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Growth of TbSpl-depleted parasites could be in part rescued by ethanolamine supplementation to the growth medium, indicating that the main function of TbSpl is to provide ethanolamine phosphate for PE synthesis. In contrast to most cell types analyzed, where SPL localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, we found by high-resolution microscopy that TbSpl is a mitochondrial protein. In spite of its mitochondrial localization, TbSpl depletion had no apparent effect on mitochondrial morphology but resulted in aggregation of acidocalcisomes. Our results link mitochondria to sphingolipid metabolism and suggest possible roles for PE in acidocalcisome function."
661,Effect of lysine acetylation on the regulation of Trypanosoma brucei glycosomal aldolase activity.,10.1042/BCJ20200142,2020-04-25,"['Trypanosoma', 'aldolase', 'differentiation', 'glycolysis', 'lysine acetylation']","Post-translational modifications provide suitable mechanisms for cellular adaptation to environmental changes. Lysine acetylation is one of these modifications and occurs with the addition of an acetyl group to Nε-amino chain of this residue, eliminating its positive charge. Recently, we found distinct acetylation profiles of procyclic and bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei, the agent of African Trypanosomiasis. Interestingly, glycolytic enzymes were more acetylated in the procyclic, which develops in insects and uses oxidative phosphorylation to obtain energy, compared with the bloodstream form, whose main source of energy is glycolysis. Here, we investigated whether acetylation regulates the T. brucei fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. We found that aldolase activity was reduced in procyclic parasites cultivated in the absence of glucose and partial recovered by in vitro deacetylation. Similarly, acetylation of protein extracts from procyclics cultivated in glucose-rich medium, caused a reduction in the aldolase activity. In addition, aldolase acetylation levels were higher in procyclics cultivated in the absence of glucose compared with those cultivated in the presence of glucose. To further confirm the role of acetylation, lysine residues near the catalytic site were substituted by glutamine in recombinant T. brucei aldolase. These replacements, especially K157, inhibited enzymatic activity, changed the electrostatic surface potential, decrease substrate binding and modify the catalytic pocket structure of the enzyme, as predicted by in silico analysis. Taken together, these data confirm the role of acetylation in regulating the activity of an enzyme from the glycolytic pathway of T. brucei, expanding the factors responsible for regulating important pathways in this parasite."

Expression of TbTfR rapidly increases upon iron starvation by post-transcriptional regulation through a currently undefined mechanism that is distinct from the mammalian iron response system. We have created reporter cell lines by fusing the TbTfR 3'UTR or a control Aldolase 3'UTR to reporter genes encoding GFP or firefly Luciferase, and inserted the fusions into a bloodstream form cell line at a tagged ribosomal RNA locus. Fusion of the TbTfR 3'UTR is sufficient to significantly repress the expression of the reporter proteins under normal growth conditions. Under iron starvation conditions we observed upregulation of the mRNA and protein level of the TbTfR 3'UTR fusions only, with a magnitude and timing consistent with that reported for upregulation of the TbTfR. We conclude that the dynamic regulation of the T. brucei transferrin receptor in response to iron starvation is mediated via its 3'UTR, and that the effect is independent of genomic location."

Distinct molecular docking algorithms were used to screen more than 500,000 compounds against the X-ray structure of the enzyme. This SBVS strategy led to the selection of a series of molecules which were evaluated for their activity on recombinant T. brucei aldolase. The effort led to the discovery of structurally new ligands able to inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme.
The predicted binding conformations were additionally investigated in molecular dynamics simulations, which provided useful insights into the enzyme-inhibitor intermolecular interactions.

The purine salvage pathways of Trypanosoma brucei being redundant, none of the involved enzymes is likely to be essential. Nevertheless they can be of pharmacological interest due to their role in activation of purine nucleobase or nucleoside analogues, which only become toxic when converted to nucleotides. Aminopurine antimetabolites, in particular, are potent trypanocides and even adenine itself is toxic to trypanosomes at elevated concentrations. Here we report on the T. brucei adenine phosphoribosyltransferases TbAPRT1 and TbAPRT2, encoded by the two genes Tb927.7.1780 and Tb927.7.1790, located in tandem on chromosome seven. The duplication is syntenic in all available Trypanosoma genomes but not in Leishmania. While TbAPRT1 is cytosolic, TbAPRT2 possesses a glycosomal targeting signal and co-localizes with the glycosomal marker aldolase. Interestingly, the distribution of glycosomal targeting signals among trypanosomatid adenine phosphoribosyltransferases is not consistent with their phylogeny, indicating that the acquisition of adenine salvage to the glycosome happened after the radiation of Trypanosoma. Double null mutant T. brucei Δtbaprt1,2 exhibited no growth phenotype but no longer incorporated exogenous adenine into the nucleotide pool. This, however, did not reduce their sensitivity to adenine. The Δtbaprt1,2 trypanosomes were resistant to the adenine isomer aminopurinol, indicating that it is activated by phosphoribosyl transfer. Aminopurinol was about 1000-fold more toxic to bloodstream-form T. brucei than the corresponding hypoxanthine isomer allopurinol. Aminopurinol uptake was not dependent on the aminopurine permease P2 that has been implicated in drug resistance."

Due to the limited number of selection markers for T. brucei, it has been difficult to generate a mutant with two genes knocked out and impractical to simultaneously knockout more than two genes, deterring detailed studies of important cellular mechanisms. The first KO strategy described can overcome the marker problem by allowing continuous re-use of drug-resistance markers. The same KO vector can be used to make a conditional KO system, when a gene of interest is essential for cell viability. As a gene of interest is removed from its original chromosomal locus by the induction of Cre recombinase, deletion is complete and instantaneous. This makes it easier to identify primary effects rather than having secondary effects obscuring phenotypic assessment, as is often the case with RNAi silencing."

Through the application of leave-one-out and leave-many-out cross-validation procedures, significant correlation coefficients were obtained (r²=0.98 and q²=0.77) as an indication of the statistical internal and external consistency of the models. The best model was employed to predict pKi values for a series of test set compounds, and the predicted values were in good agreement with the experimental results, showing the power of the model for untested compounds. Moreover, structure-based molecular modeling studies were performed to investigate the binding mode of the inhibitors in the active site of the parasitic target enzyme.

The bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei lack cytochromes and respire exclusively via TAO. On the other hand, the insect, or procyclic form possesses a fully developed cytochrome system, and down regulates TAO several folds by reducing the stability of the TAO transcript. We expressed an ectopic copy of TAO in the procyclic form from a tetracycline regulated stable expression vector, in which the TAO 3'-UTR was replaced by T. brucei aldolase 3'-UTR. The TAO transcript produced from the ectopic copy was stably accumulated in the procyclic form. Upon induction with doxycycline, TAO protein level was gradually increased about five-fold within 72 h. TAO over-expression did not show any effect on the growth of the parasite. The rate of respiration and the SHAM-sensitive respiratory pathway capacity was increased about two- and five-fold, respectively, and the cytochrome-mediated respiratory pathway capacity was reduced two- to three-folds within 5 days after induction of TAO. Doxycycline induced TAO+ cells preferentially utilized CN-resistant, SHAM-sensitive pathway of respiration, whereas, in the control cells 70-80% of total respiration was via the CN-sensitive pathway. Moreover, we have found that increased expression of TAO caused about two-fold down regulation of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV, and cytochrome c1 protein level and also caused a four-fold up-regulation of the expression of the surface coat protein, GPEET procyclin in the procyclic form. This suggests that the expression of two terminal oxidases and the coat protein is linked in T. brucei."

To determine the potential role of proteasomes and other proteases during the differentiation process, we tested the effect of lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of proteasome activity, and morpholinourea-Phe-homoPhe-benz-alpha-pyrone (P27), a selective inhibitor of cysteine proteases, on the in vitro differentiation of T. brucei. Cells differentiated normally in the presence of 1 microM lactacystin, which confirmed our previous observation that this differentiation does not require crossing any phase boundaries in the cell cycle (Mutomba and Wang, Mol Biochem Parasitol 1996;80:89-102). But the cells thus differentiated did not increase in number and retained gPGK. Cells differentiated under 2 microM P27 also proceeded at a normal rate but failed to multiply and retained gPGK. However, most of the differentiated cells under 2 microM P27 also retained VSG on the cell membrane surface and expressed higher levels of procyclin suggesting that a cysteine protease(s) may be involved in releasing VSG and partially reducing procyclin during differentiation. This cysteine protease(s) has been tentatively identified in the procyclic cells as a 48 kDa protein through labeling of cysteine protease(s) with a biotinylated P27 homolog K02 (morpholinourea-Phe-homoPhe-vinylsulfone)."

This library was used for affinity screening against the fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase of Trypanosoma brucei labeled with biotin as well as versus the COOH-terminal labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The thus selected peptide beads were identified and the appropriate sequences synthesized as peptide amides and evaluated for enzyme activity inhibition. Screening against the whole enzyme did not result in selection of an enzyme inhibitor. However, we demonstrate here that screening against a part of the enzyme involved in the catalytic activity may lead to the discovery of an enzyme inhibitor as well as an enzyme activator. Two low affinity inhibitors, RRVKF-NH2 and KThiKAR-NH2, with an IC50 of approximately 1 mM and approximately 0.2 mM, respectively, were identified. Two other pentapeptides with the sequence SWChaKK-NH2 and SKChaKM-NH2 are able to activate the enzyme fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase. Thus, successful screening of solid phase libraries can be accomplished using selected sequences of the target enzyme."
682,Role of 3'-untranslated regions in the regulation of hexose transporter mRNAs in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(95)02503-0,1995-12-01,[],"Trypanosoma brucei is a unicellular parasite that is transmitted from one mammalian host to the next by tsetse flies. The expression of many trypanosome genes is regulated during the life cycle but there is no evidence for developmental control of transcription by RNA polymerase II. T. brucei expresses at least two hexose transporter mRNAs that are developmentally regulated; we show here that specific portions of the 3'-untranslated regions are responsible for the differential expression. Different trypanosome 3'-untranslated regions, from surface protein, phosphoglycerate kinase and aldolase genes as well as the hexose transporter genes, conferred a spectrum of levels of reporter gene expression, and these activities differed between bloodstream forms and the procyclic forms that replicate in the tsetse vector. Experiments with permanently transformed cell lines showed that regulation occurs at the mRNA level. The results suggest that post-transcriptional control of mRNAs in trypanosomatids operates at several levels, and that it will not always be possible to attribute all the regulation to short RNA motifs."

All members of the Trypanosomatidae family contain subpellicular microtubules cross-linked to each other and to the plasma membrane by unique trypanosomal microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). These MAPs may serve as specific intracellular target sites for therapeutic attack against trypanosomiasis. A trypanosomal MAP (p52) copurifies with two glycosomal enzymes (aldolase and GAPDH) on phosphocellulose columns. Rats and mice vaccinated with antigen preparation p52 containing the glycosomal enzymes were protected against a potentially fatal Trypanosoma brucei infection. Sera of protected animals caused in vitro aggregation of trypanosomes, and immunoelectron microscopy of these aggregates located antibodies in the cytoplasm of the trypanosomes."

Therefore, a specific restriction site was introduced by mutagenesis at the front of the gene, enabling its ligation in an expression plasmid, immediately downstream of the regulatory sequences. Growth conditions were established for production of high amounts of soluble and active enzyme. Aldolase was purified to near-homogeneity from the soluble fraction of the bacterial lysate by nuclease treatment, differential precipitation steps, and passage over a CM-Sepharose column. From a 1-liter culture of E. coli cells, 60-120 mg of purified protein that is essentially indistinguishable in physicochemical and kinetic properties and in stability from the enzyme purified from trypanosomes grown in infected laboratory animals was reproducibly obtained."

In addition, different features of this metabolism and those associated with glycolytic enzymes offer opportunities for the development of efficient and selective compounds. Examples are given in this work of inhibitors directed to the enzymes aldolase and glyceraldehyde-phosphate-dehydrogenase and also of molecules acting specifically on the clusters of basic amino-acids present at the surfaces of the glycolytic enzymes in the parasite."

The untranslated regions surrounding the luciferase gene were derived from the actin, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, or PARP loci. Trans-splicing of the resulting transcripts occurred as expected, but the site of 3' polyadenylation was upstream of the position anticipated. The nature of the 3'-untranslated region was crucial to the level of expression in bloodstream forms."
689,Chemical modification of fructose bisphosphate aldolase from Trypanosoma brucei compared to aldolase from rabbit muscle and Staphylococcus aureus.,10.1016/0166-6851(91)90143-t,1991-07-01,[],"Chemical modifications of Class I aldolases from Trypanosoma brucei, rabbit muscle and Staphylococcus aureus with carboxypeptidase A, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and cysteine-specific reagents revealed the following differences between the three homologous enzymes. Aldolase from S. aureus was not affected by any of these reagents. Carboxypeptidase-A treatment of rabbit-muscle and T. brucei aldolase inhibited the activity of both enzymes towards fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru(1,6)P2), while the activity towards fructose-1-phosphate (Fru-1-P) was affected only in the case of the trypanosomal enzyme. Moreover carboxypeptidase-A treatment reduced the turnover numbers of these two aldolases for both Fru(1,6)P2 and Fru-1-P to a similar level. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, in the absence of dihydroxyacetone phosphate, also inactivated aldolases from rabbit muscle and T. brucei with second order rate constants of 1054 and 254 min-1 M-1, respectively. Using 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) with rabbit-muscle aldolase, a total of 4 thiol groups could be titrated per subunit, resulting in a total inactivation. The presence of substrate completely protected the enzyme from inactivation. Methyl methanethiosulfonate also reacted with four cysteine residues, but this led to very little inactivation. This indicates that the inactivation by modification with DTNB is due to conformational changes in the enzyme. In T. brucei aldolase only one thiol group could be titrated with methyl methanesulfonate and there was no loss of activity. With 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) five cysteines were titrated with an immediate and complete loss of activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
690,Kinetic properties of fructose bisphosphate aldolase from Trypanosoma brucei compared to aldolase from rabbit muscle and Staphylococcus aureus.,10.1016/0166-6851(91)90142-s,1991-07-01,[],"The kinetic properties of aldolase from Trypanosoma brucei were studied in comparison with aldolase from rabbit muscle and Staphylococcus aureus. The 3 enzymes displayed a similar broad pH optimum for the cleavage of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru(1,6)P2) and a similar narrow pH optimum for the cleavage of fructose 1-phosphate (Fru-1-P). However, small alterations in the maximal cleavage rate at more extreme pH values yielded disparities between the pH curves. The reaction catalyzed by the aldolases from T. brucei and S. aureus proceeded via an ordered sequence, as described for the rabbit-muscle enzyme. We determined for the 3 enzymes the kinetic parameters for both the cleavage and the formation of Fru(1,6)P2 and for the cleavage of Fru-1-P. The trypanosomal enzyme differed in its higher ratio of the maximal rate of Fru(1,6)P2-cleavage vs. the maximal rate of Fru(1,6)P2-formation, its higher affinity towards dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and its higher turnover number for the cleavage of Fru-1-P. At ionic strengths above 0.1 M the kinetic parameters of the trypanosomal enzyme followed the limited form of the Debye-Hückel equation. At ionic strengths below 0.1 M the enzyme revealed a characteristic deviation: the apparent Km for Fru(1,6)P2 increased with decreasing salt concentration. The trypanosomal aldolase was competitively inhibited by adenine nucleotides and phosphates. This inhibition occurred in the same concentration range as observed for the rabbit-muscle enzyme, while the bacterial enzyme was less affected."
691,The association of glycosomal enzymes and microtubules: a physiological phenomenon or an experimental artifact?,10.1016/0014-4827(90)90008-x,1990-12-01,[],"Subpellicular microtubules isolated from Trypanosoma brucei parasites were fractionated on a phosphocellulose column, and the trypanosomal p52 microtubule-associated protein was eluted along with two other proteins of 41 and 36 kDa. These proteins were found to be the glycosomal enzymes aldolase (41 kDa) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, 36 kDa) by enzyme activity, antibody cross-reaction, and N-terminal sequencing. These enzymes were coprecipitated with tubulin in the presence of taxol, and aldolase had the capacity to polymerize tubulin and crosslink microtubules. Immunolocalization of anti-aldolase and anti-GAPDH antibodies did not show an interaction between these enzymes and the subpellicular microtubules. The question whether the copurification of aldolase and the subpellicular microtubules could reflect a physiological phenomenon or may be an experimental artifact is discussed."

695,Phosphorylation of fructose bisphosphate aldolase in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(89)90044-3,1989-02-01,[],Methods were developed for in vivo labelling of trypanosome proteins with inorganic phosphate and the labelling of fructose bisphosphate aldolase and variant surface glycoprotein was investigated. It was found that the large pool size of phosphate in trypanosomes precludes detailed kinetic analyses. Aldolase contains low levels of phosphoserine but the function of this phosphorylation has yet to be determined.
696,Characterization of the genes for fructose-bisphosphate aldolase in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(88)90121-1,1988-05-01,[],"In Trypanosoma brucei stock 427 the glycolytic enzyme fructose-bisphosphate aldolase is encoded by two tandemly linked genes of identical sequence. Such a tandem arrangement of aldolase genes is also present in other T. brucei stocks of unrelated origin. In stock 427 one of the allelic genes is a pseudogene, as a result of a one-nucleotide deletion. The genes code for a polypeptide of 371 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of 40,940. The protein that is predicted from the gene sequence has 45-48% positional identity with known aldolase sequences of other organisms. The trypanosomal protein is, however, unique in having a 10 amino-acid insertion near its N-terminus and high number of basic residues, a feature it shares with other glycolytic enzymes of T. brucei. These glycolytic enzymes have in common that they are located in microbody-like organelles, the glycosomes. We have previously proposed that the positively charged residues may be involved in the import of the proteins into the organelles."

698,The predicted secondary structures of class I fructose-bisphosphate aldolases.,10.1042/bj2490789,1988-02-01,[],"The results of several secondary-structure prediction programs were combined to produce an estimate of the regions of alpha-helix, beta-sheet and reverse turns for fructose-bisphosphate aldolases from human and rat muscle and liver, from Trypanosoma brucei and from Drosophila melanogaster. All the aldolase sequences gave essentially the same pattern of secondary-structure predictions despite having sequences up to 50% different. One exception to this pattern was an additional strongly predicted helix in the rat liver and Drosophila enzymes. Regions of relatively high sequence variation generally were predicted as reverse turns, and probably occur as surface loops. Most of the positions corresponding to exon boundaries are located between regions predicted to have secondary-structural elements consistent with a compact structure. The predominantly alternating alpha/beta structure predicted is consistent with the alpha/beta-barrel structure indicated by preliminary high-resolution X-ray diffraction studies on rabbit muscle aldolase [Sygusch, Beaudry & Allaire (1986) Biophys. J. 49, 287a]."
699,Import of fructose bisphosphate aldolase into the glycosomes of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1083/jcb.105.6.2649,1987-12-01,[],"The glycolytic enzymes of Trypanosomatids are compartmentalized within peroxisome-like microbodies called glycosomes. Fructose bisphosphate aldolase is synthesized on free polysomes and imported into glycosomes within 5 min. Peptide mapping reveals no primary structural differences between the in vivo-synthesized protein and that made in vitro from a synthetic template. However, native aldolase from glycosomes is partially protease resistant, whereas the in vitro translation product is not. Pulse-chase results indicate that aldolase in bloodstream trypanosomes has a much longer half-life than in the procyclic tsetse fly form."
701,Common elements on the surface of glycolytic enzymes from Trypanosoma brucei may serve as topogenic signals for import into glycosomes.,10.1002/j.1460-2075.1987.tb04741.x,1987-01-01,[],"In Trypanosoma brucei, a major pathogenic protozoan parasite of Central Africa, a number of glycolytic enzymes present in the cytosol of other organisms are uniquely segregated in a microbody-like organelle, the glycosome, which they are believed to reach post-translationally after being synthesized by free ribosomes in the cytosol. In a search for possible topogenic signals responsible for import into glycosomes we have compared the amino acid sequences of four glycosomal enzymes: triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and aldolase (ALDO), with each other and with their cytosolic counterparts. Each of these enzymes contains a marked excess of positive charges, distributed in two or more clusters along the polypeptide chain. Modelling of the three-dimensional structures of TIM, PGK and GAPDH using the known structural coordinates of homologous enzymes from other organisms indicates that all three may have in common two 'hot spots' about 40 A apart, which themselves include a pair of basic amino acid residues separated by a distance of about 7 A. The sequence of glycosomal ALDO, for which no three-dimensional information is available, is compatible with the presence of the same configuration on the surface of this enzyme. We propose that this feature plays an essential role in the import of enzymes into glycosomes."
705,Evolutionary aspects of trypanosomes: analysis of genes.,10.1007/BF02099950,1986-01-01,[],"The genes for four glycolytic enzymes of Trypanosoma brucei have been analyzed. The proteins encoded by these genes show 38-57% identity with their counterparts in other organisms, whether pro- or eukaryotic. These data are consistent with a phylogenetic tree in which trypanosomes diverged very early from the main branch of the eukaryotic lineage. No definite conclusion can be drawn yet about the evolutionary origin of glycosomes, the microbodies of trypanosomes which contain most enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. A bias could be observed in the codon usage of the glycolytic genes and genes for other housekeeping proteins, indicating that trypanosomes may have selected a nucleotide sequence that enables efficient translation. However, the genes for variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) do not show such a bias. This lack of preference for special codons is explained by the high evolutionary rate that could be observed for VSG genes."

A clone which is almost full length encodes a protein of 41 027 daltons which has 50% identity with rabbit aldolase A and slightly lower homology with B-type aldolases. The homologous mRNA is at least 6-fold more abundant in bloodstream trypomastigotes than in procyclic forms, as expected from measurements of enzyme activity. Genomic mapping results indicate that trypanosomes have four copies of the aldolase gene arranged as two copies of a tandem repeat. The protein has a short N-terminal extension (relative to other known aldolases) which could be involved in the glycosomal localisation of the enzyme."

While a role for active site residues can be proposed based on structure and mechanism, our understanding of the catalytic importance for residues surrounding the active site is less well understood. In triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), Glu97 is situated adjacent to the active site and is found in essentially all sequences. Prior studies reported mutation of Glu97 to Asp and Gln in TIM from Plasmodium falciparum (PfTIM) led to a 100- and 4000-fold decrease in activity, respectively, while the E97D mutation in TIM from Gallus gallus (cTIM) had no effect on activity. To investigate further the question of how mutations in essentially superimposable structures give different effects, we mutated E97 in TIM from Trypanosoma brucei brucei (TbbTIM), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yTIM), and human (hTIM).

A comparison with the corresponding parameters for wild-type, I172A, and L232A TbbTIM-catalyzed reactions shows that the effect of I172A and L232A mutations on ΔG(⧧) for the wild-type TbbTIM-catalyzed reactions of the substrate pieces is nearly the same as the effect of the same mutations on TbbTIM previously mutated at the second side chain. This provides strong evidence that mutation of the first hydrophobic side chain does not affect the functioning of the second side chain in catalysis of the reactions of the substrate pieces. By contrast, the effects of I172A and L232A mutations on ΔG(⧧) for wild-type TbbTIM-catalyzed reactions of the whole substrate are different from the effect of the same mutations on TbbTIM previously mutated at the second side chain. This is due to the change in the rate-determining step that determines the barrier to the isomerization reaction. X-ray crystal structures are reported for I172A, L232A, and I172A/L232A TIMs and for the complexes of these mutants to the intermediate analogue phosphoglycolate (PGA). The structures of the PGA complexes with wild-type and mutant enzymes are nearly superimposable, except that the space opened by replacement of the hydrophobic side chain is occupied by a water molecule that lies ∼3.5 Å from the basic side chain of Glu167. The new water at I172A mutant TbbTIM provides a simple rationalization for the increase in the activation barrier ΔG(⧧) observed for mutant enzyme-catalyzed reactions of the whole substrate and substrate pieces. By contrast, the new water at the L232A mutant does not predict the decrease in ΔG(⧧) observed for the mutant enzyme-catalyzed reactions of the substrate piece GA."
722,Enzyme architecture: remarkably similar transition states for triosephosphate isomerase-catalyzed reactions of the whole substrate and the substrate in pieces.,10.1021/ja501103b,2014-03-05,[],"Values of (k(cat)/K(m))GAP for triosephosphate isomerase-catalyzed reactions of (R)-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and k(cat)/K(HPi)K(GA) for reactions of the substrate pieces glycolaldehyde and HPO3(2-) have been determined for wild-type and the following TIM mutants: I172V, I172A, L232A, and P168A (TIM from Trypanosoma brucei brucei); a 208-TGAG for 208-YGGS loop 7 replacement mutant (L7RM, TIM from chicken muscle); and, Y208T, Y208S, Y208A, Y208F and S211A (yeast TIM). A superb linear logarithmic correlation, with slope of 1.04 ± 0.03, is observed between the kinetic parameters for wild-type and most mutant enzymes, with positive deviations for L232A and L7RM. The unit slope shows that most mutations result in an identical change in the activation barriers for the catalyzed reactions of whole substrate and substrate pieces, so that the two transition states are stabilized by similar interactions with the protein catalyst. This is consistent with a role for dianions as active spectators, which hold TIM in a catalytically active caged form."

In most organisms, its functional oligomeric state is a homodimer; however, tetramer formation in hyperthermophiles is required for functional activity. The tetrameric TIM structure also provides added stability to the structure, enabling it to function at more extreme temperatures. We apply Principal Component Analysis to find that the TIM structure space is clearly divided into two groups--the open and the closed TIM structures. The distribution of the structures in the open set is much sparser than that in the closed set, showing a greater conformational diversity of the open structures. We also apply the Elastic Network Model to four different TIM structures--an engineered monomeric structure, a dimeric structure from a mesophile--Trypanosoma brucei, and two tetrameric structures from hyperthermophiles Thermotoga maritima and Pyrococcus woesei. We find that dimerization not only stabilizes the structures, it also enhances their functional dynamics. Moreover, tetramerization of the hyperthermophilic structures increases their functional loop dynamics, enabling them to function in the destabilizing environment of extreme temperatures. Computations also show that the functional loop motions, especially loops 6 and 7, are highly coordinated. In summary, our computations reveal the underlying mechanism of the allosteric regulation of the functional loops of the TIM structures, and show that tetramerization of the structure as found in the hyperthermophilic organisms is required to maintain the coordination of the functional loops at a level similar to that in the dimeric mesophilic structure."
724,Different contribution of conserved amino acids to the global properties of triosephosphate isomerases.,10.1002/prot.24398,2013-08-24,"['free-energy barriers', 'homologous enzymes', 'kinetic stability', 'protein denaturation', 'transition-state plasticity']","It is generally assumed that the amino acids that exist in all homologous enzymes correspond to residues that participate in catalysis, or that are essential for folding and stability. Although this holds for catalytic residues, the function of conserved noncatalytic residues is not clear. It is not known if such residues are of equal importance and have the same role in different homologous enzymes. In humans, the E104D mutation in triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) is the most frequent mutation in the autosomal diseases named ""TPI deficiencies."" We explored if the E104D mutation has the same impact in TIMs from four different organisms (Homo sapiens, Giardia lamblia, Trypanosoma cruzi, and T. brucei). The catalytic properties were not significantly affected by the mutation, but it affected the rate and extent of formation of active dimers from unfolded monomers differently. Scanning calorimetry experiments indicated that the mutation was in all cases destabilizing, but the mutation effect on rates of irreversible denaturation and transition-state energetics were drastically dependent on the TIM background. For instance, the E104D mutation produce changes in activation energy ranging from 430 kJ mol(-1) in HsTIM to -78 kJ mol(-1) in TcTIM. Thus, in TIM the role of a conserved noncatalytic residue is drastically dependent on its molecular background. Accordingly, it would seem that because each protein has a particular sequence, and a distinctive set of amino acid interactions, it should be regarded as a unique entity that has evolved for function and stability in the organisms to which it belongs."
725,Structural mutations that probe the interactions between the catalytic and dianion activation sites of triosephosphate isomerase.,10.1021/bi401019h,2013-08-06,[],"Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) catalyzes the isomerization of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to form d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The effects of two structural mutations in TIM on the kinetic parameters for catalysis of the reaction of the truncated substrate glycolaldehyde (GA) and the activation of this reaction by phosphite dianion are reported. The P168A mutation results in similar 50- and 80-fold decreases in (kcat/Km)E and (kcat/Km)E·HPi, respectively, for deprotonation of GA catalyzed by free TIM and by the TIM·HPO(3)(2-) complex. The mutation has little effect on the observed and intrinsic phosphite dianion binding energy or the magnitude of phosphite dianion activation of TIM for catalysis of deprotonation of GA. A loop 7 replacement mutant (L7RM) of TIM from chicken muscle was prepared by substitution of the archaeal sequence 208-TGAG with 208-YGGS. L7RM exhibits a 25-fold decrease in (kcat/Km)E and a larger 170-fold decrease in (kcat/Km)E·HPi for reactions of GA. The mutation has little effect on the observed and intrinsic phosphodianion binding energy and only a modest effect on phosphite dianion activation of TIM. The observation that both the P168A and loop 7 replacement mutations affect mainly the kinetic parameters for TIM-catalyzed deprotonation but result in much smaller changes in the parameters for enzyme activation by phosphite dianion provides support for the conclusion that catalysis of proton transfer and dianion activation of TIM take place at separate, weakly interacting, sites in the protein catalyst."
726,Magnitude and origin of the enhanced basicity of the catalytic glutamate of triosephosphate isomerase.,10.1021/ja401504w,2013-04-09,[],"Glu-167 of triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei brucei (TbbTIM) acts as the base to deprotonate substrate to form an enediolate phosphate trianion intermediate. We report that there is a large ~6 pK unit increase in the basicity of the carboxylate side chain of Glu-167 upon binding of the inhibitor phosphoglycolate trianion (I(3-)), an analog of the enediolate phosphate intermediate, from pKEH ≈ 4 for the protonated free enzyme EH to pK(EHI) ≈ 10 for the protonated enzyme-inhibitor complex EH•I(3-). We propose that there is a similar increase in the basicity of this side chain when the physiological substrates are deprotonated by TbbTIM to form an enediolate phosphate trianion intermediate and that it makes an important contribution to the enzymatic rate acceleration. The affinity of wildtype TbbTIM for I(3-) increases 20,000-fold upon decreasing the pH from 9.3 to 4.9, because TbbTIM exists mainly in the basic form E over this pH range, while the inhibitor binds specifically to the rare protonated enzyme EH. This reflects the large increase in the basicity of the carboxylate side chain of Glu-167 upon binding of I(3-) to EH to give EH•I(3-). The I172A mutation at TbbTIM results in an ~100-fold decrease in the affinity of TbbTIM for I(3-) at pH < 6 and an ~2 pK unit decrease in the basicity of the carboxylate side chain of Glu-167 at the EH•I(3-) complex, to pK(EHI) = 7.7. Therefore, the hydrophobic side chain of Ile-172 plays a critical role in effecting the large increase in the basicity of the catalytic base upon the binding of substrate and/or inhibitors."
727,In-silico investigation of antitrypanosomal phytochemicals from Nigerian medicinal plants.,10.1371/journal.pntd.0001727,2012-08-01,[],"Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), a parasitic protozoal disease, is caused primarily by two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei. HAT is a re-emerging disease and currently threatens millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa. Many affected people live in remote areas with limited access to health services and, therefore, rely on traditional herbal medicines for treatment.
A molecular docking study has been carried out on phytochemical agents that have been previously isolated and characterized from Nigerian medicinal plants, either known to be used ethnopharmacologically to treat parasitic infections or known to have in-vitro antitrypanosomal activity. A total of 386 compounds from 19 species of medicinal plants were investigated using in-silico molecular docking with validated Trypanosoma brucei protein targets that were available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB): Adenosine kinase (TbAK), pteridine reductase 1 (TbPTR1), dihydrofolate reductase (TbDHFR), trypanothione reductase (TbTR), cathepsin B (TbCatB), heat shock protein 90 (TbHSP90), sterol 14α-demethylase (TbCYP51), nucleoside hydrolase (TbNH), triose phosphate isomerase (TbTIM), nucleoside 2-deoxyribosyltransferase (TbNDRT), UDP-galactose 4' epimerase (TbUDPGE), and ornithine decarboxylase (TbODC).
This study revealed that triterpenoid and steroid ligands were largely selective for sterol 14α-demethylase; anthraquinones, xanthones, and berberine alkaloids docked strongly to pteridine reductase 1 (TbPTR1); chromenes, pyrazole and pyridine alkaloids preferred docking to triose phosphate isomerase (TbTIM); and numerous indole alkaloids showed notable docking energies with UDP-galactose 4' epimerase (TbUDPGE). Polyphenolic compounds such as flavonoid gallates or flavonoid glycosides tended to be promiscuous docking agents, giving strong docking energies with most proteins.
This in-silico molecular docking study has identified potential biomolecular targets of phytochemical components of antitrypanosomal plants and has determined which phytochemical classes and structural manifolds likely target trypanosomal enzymes. The results could provide the framework for synthetic modification of bioactive phytochemicals, de novo synthesis of structural motifs, and lead to further phytochemical investigations."
728,Mechanism for activation of triosephosphate isomerase by phosphite dianion: the role of a hydrophobic clamp.,10.1021/ja303695u,2012-05-16,[],"The role of the hydrophobic side chains of Ile-172 and Leu-232 in catalysis of the reversible isomerization of R-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) by triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from Trypanosoma brucei brucei (Tbb) has been investigated. The I172A and L232A mutations result in 100- and 6-fold decreases in k(cat)/K(m) for the isomerization reaction, respectively. The effect of the mutations on the product distributions for the catalyzed reactions of GAP and of [1-(13)C]-glycolaldehyde ([1-(13)C]-GA) in D(2)O is reported. The 40% yield of DHAP from wild-type Tbb TIM-catalyzed isomerization of GAP with intramolecular transfer of hydrogen is found to decrease to 13% and to 4%, respectively, for the reactions catalyzed by the I172A and L232A mutants. Likewise, the 13% yield of [2-(13)C]-GA from isomerization of [1-(13)C]-GA in D(2)O is found to decrease to 2% and to 1%, respectively, for the reactions catalyzed by the I172A and L232A mutants. The decrease in the yield of the product of intramolecular transfer of hydrogen is consistent with a repositioning of groups at the active site that favors transfer of the substrate-derived hydrogen to the protein or the oxygen anion of the bound intermediate. The I172A and L232A mutations result in (a) a >10-fold decrease (I172A) and a 17-fold increase (L232A) in the second-order rate constant for the TIM-catalyzed reaction of [1-(13)C]-GA in D(2)O, (b) a 170-fold decrease (I172A) and 25-fold increase (L232A) in the third-order rate constant for phosphite dianion (HPO(3)(2-)) activation of the TIM-catalyzed reaction of GA in D(2)O, and (c) a 1.5-fold decrease (I172A) and a larger 16-fold decrease (L232A) in K(d) for activation of TIM by HPO(3)(2-) in D(2)O. The effects of the I172A mutation on the kinetic parameters for the wild-type TIM-catalyzed reactions of the whole substrate and substrate pieces are consistent with a decrease in the basicity of the carboxylate side chain of Glu-167 for the mutant enzyme. The data provide striking evidence that the L232A mutation leads to a ca. 1.7 kcal/mol stabilization of a catalytically active loop-closed form of TIM (E(C)) relative to an inactive open form (E(O))."

The equilibrium folding pathway was found to include two intermediates (N(2) ↔I(2) ↔2M↔2U). According to this model, the conformational stability parameters of TIM are as follows: ΔG(I2-N2) = 5.5 ± 0.6, ΔG(2M-I2) =19.6 ± 1.6, and ΔG(2U-2M) = 14.7 ± 3.1 kcal mol(-1) . The I(2) state is compact (α(SR) = 0.8); it is able to bind 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid ANS and it is composed of ∼45% of α-helix and tertiary structure content compared with the native enzyme; however, it is unable to bind the transition-state analog 2-phosphoglycolate. Conversely, the 2M state lacks detectable tertiary contacts, possesses ∼10% of the native α-helical content, is significantly expanded (α(SR) = 0.2), and has low affinity for ANS. We studied the effect of mutating cysteine residues on the structure and stability of I(2) and 2M. Three mutants were made: C39A, C126A, and C39A/C126A. The replacement of C39, which is located at β(2) , was found to be neutral. The I(2) -C126A state, however, was prone to aggregation and exhibited an emission maximum that was 3-nm red-shifted compared with the I(2) -wild type, indicating solvent exposure of W90 at β(4) . Our results suggest that the I(2) state comprises the (βα)(1-4) β(5) module in which the conserved C126 residue located at β(5) defines the boundary of the folded segment. We propose a folding pathway that highlights the remarkable thermodynamic stability of this glycosomal enzyme."

In contrast, this mutation leads to a 17-fold increase in the second-order rate constant for the TIM-catalyzed proton transfer reaction of the truncated substrate piece [1-(13)C]glycolaldehyde ([1-(13)C]-GA) in D(2)O, a 25-fold increase in the third-order rate constant for the reaction of the substrate pieces GA and phosphite dianion (HPO(3)(2-)), and a 16-fold decrease in K(d) for binding of HPO(3)(2-) to the free enzyme. Most significantly, the mutation also results in an 11-fold decrease in the extent of activation of the enzyme toward turnover of GA by bound HPO(3)(2-). The data provide striking evidence that the L232A mutation leads to a ca. 1.7 kcal/mol stabilization of a catalytically active loop-closed form of TIM (E(c)) relative to an inactive open form (E(o)). We propose that this is due to the relief, in L232A mutant TIM, of unfavorable steric interactions between the bulky hydrophobic side chain of Leu-232 and the basic carboxylate side chain of Glu-167, the catalytic base, which destabilize E(c) relative to E(o)."
732,Wildtype and engineered monomeric triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei: partitioning of reaction intermediates in D2O and activation by phosphite dianion.,10.1021/bi2005416,2011-05-11,[],"Product yields for the reactions of (R)-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) in D2O at pD 7.9 catalyzed by wildtype triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei brucei (Tbb TIM) and a monomeric variant (monoTIM) of this wildtype enzyme were determined by (1)H NMR spectroscopy and were compared with the yields determined in earlier work for the reactions catalyzed by TIM from rabbit and chicken muscle [O'Donoghue, A. C., Amyes, T. L., and Richard, J. P. (2005), Biochemistry 44, 2610 - 2621]. Three products were observed from the reactions catalyzed by TIM: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) from isomerization with intramolecular transfer of hydrogen, d-DHAP from isomerization with incorporation of deuterium from D2O into C-1 of DHAP, and d-GAP from incorporation of deuterium from D2O into C-2 of GAP. The yield of DHAP formed by intramolecular transfer of hydrogen decreases from 49% for the muscle enzymes to 40% for wildtype Tbb TIM to 34% for monoTIM. There is no significant difference in the ratio of the yields of d-DHAP and d-GAP for wildtype TIM from muscle sources and Trypanosoma brucei brucei, but partitioning of the enediolate intermediate of the monoTIM reaction to form d-DHAP is less favorable ((k(C1))(D)/(k(C2))(D) = 1.1) than for the wildtype enzyme ((k(C1))(D)/(k(C2))(D) = 1.7). Product yields for the wildtype Tbb TIM and monoTIM-catalyzed reactions of glycolaldehyde labeled with carbon-13 at the carbonyl carbon ([1-(13)C]-GA) at pD 7.0 in the presence of phosphite dianion and in its absence were determined by (1)H NMR spectroscopy [Go, M. K., Amyes, T. L., and Richard, J. P. (2009) Biochemistry 48, 5769-5778]. There is no detectable difference in the yields of the products of wildtype muscle and Tbb TIM-catalyzed reactions of [1-(13)C]-GA in D2O. The kinetic parameters for phosphite dianion activation of the reactions of [1-(13)C]-GA catalyzed by wildtype Tbb TIM are similar to those reported for the enzyme from rabbit muscle [Amyes, T. L. and Richard, J. P. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 5841-5854], but there is no detectable dianion activation of the reaction catalyzed by monoTIM. The engineered disruption of subunit contacts at monoTIM causes movement of the essential side chains of Lys-13 and His-95 away from the catalytic active positions. We suggest that this places an increased demand that the intrinsic binding energy of phosphite dianion be utilized to drive the change in the conformation of monoTIM back to the active structure for wildtype TIM."
733,Crystallographic binding studies with an engineered monomeric variant of triosephosphate isomerase.,10.1107/S0907444910025710,2010-08-10,[],"Crystallographic binding studies have been carried out to probe the active-site binding properties of a monomeric variant (A-TIM) of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM). These binding studies are part of a structure-based directed-evolution project aimed towards changing the substrate specificity of monomeric TIM and are therefore aimed at finding binders which are substrate-like molecules. A-TIM has a modified more extended binding pocket between loop-7 and loop-8 compared with wild-type TIM. The A-TIM crystals were grown in the presence of citrate, which is bound in the active site of each of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. In this complex, the active-site loops loop-6 and loop-7 adopt the closed conformation, similar to that observed in liganded wild-type TIM. Extensive crystal-soaking protocols have been developed to flush the bound citrate out of the active-site pocket of both molecules and the crystal structure shows that the unliganded open conformation of the A-TIM active site is the same as in unliganded wild-type TIM. It is also shown that sulfonate compounds corresponding to the transition-state analogue 2-phosphoglycolate bind in the active site, which has a closed conformation. It is also shown that the new binding pocket of A-TIM can bind 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA; an analogue of a C4-sugar phosphate) and 4-phospho-D-erythronohydroxamic acid (4PEH; an analogue of a C5-sugar phosphate). Therefore, these studies have provided a rationale for starting directed-evolution experiments aimed at generating the catalytic properties of a C5-sugar phosphate isomerase on the A-TIM framework."
734,An internal sequence targets Trypanosoma brucei triosephosphate isomerase to glycosomes.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2010.01.002,2010-02-09,[],"In kinetoplastid protists, glycolysis is compartmentalized in glycosomes, organelles belonging to the peroxisome family. The Trypanosoma brucei glycosomal enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) does not contain either of the two established peroxisome-targeting signals, but we identified a 22 amino acids long fragment, present at an internal position of the polypeptide, that has the capacity to route a reporter protein to glycosomes in transfected trypanosomes, as demonstrated by cell-fractionation experiments and corroborating immunofluorescence studies. This polypeptide-internal routing information seems to be unique for the sequence of the trypanosome enzyme: a reporter protein fused to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae peptide containing the sequence corresponding to the 22-residue fragment of the T. brucei enzyme, was not targeted to glycosomes. In yeasts, as in most other organisms, TPI is indeed exclusively present in the cytosol. These results suggest that it may be possible to develop new trypanocidal drugs by targeting specifically the glycosome import mechanism of TPI."
735,Structural effects of a dimer interface mutation on catalytic activity of triosephosphate isomerase. The role of conserved residues and complementary mutations.,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07126.x,2009-07-09,[],"The active site of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM, EC: 5.3.1.1), a dimeric enzyme, lies very close to the subunit interface. Attempts to engineer monomeric enzymes have yielded well-folded proteins with dramatically reduced activity. The role of dimer interface residues in the stability and activity of the Plasmodium falciparum enzyme, PfTIM, has been probed by analysis of mutational effects at residue 74. The PfTIM triple mutant W11F/W168F/Y74W (Y74W*) has been shown to dissociate at low protein concentrations, and exhibits considerably reduced stability in the presence of denaturants, urea and guanidinium chloride. The Y74W* mutant exhibits concentration-dependent activity, with an approximately 22-fold enhancement of k(cat) over a concentration range of 2.5-40 microM, suggesting that dimerization is obligatory for enzyme activity. The Y74W* mutant shows an approximately 20-fold reduction in activity compared to the control enzyme (PfTIM WT*, W11F/W168F). Careful inspection of the available crystal structures of the enzyme, together with 412 unique protein sequences, revealed the importance of conserved residues in the vicinity of the active site that serve to position the functional K12 residue. The network of key interactions spans the interacting subunits. The Y74W* mutation can perturb orientations of the active site residues, due to steric clashes with proximal aromatic residues in PfTIM. The available crystal structures of the enzyme from Giardia lamblia, which contains a Trp residue at the structurally equivalent position, establishes the need for complementary mutations and maintenance of weak interactions in order to accommodate the bulky side chain and preserve active site integrity."

The in-silico calculations predicted that lowest energy docked poses of a number of the compounds can interact with catalysis-dependent residues, thus making them possible catalytic inhibitors and of course physiologically active.

737,Key residues of loop 3 in the interaction with the interface residue at position 14 in triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1021/bi702439r,2008-02-27,[],"Cysteine 14 is an interface residue that is fundamental for the catalysis and stability of homodimeric triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei (TbTIM). Its side chain is surrounded by a deep pocket of 11 residues that are part of loop 3 of the adjacent monomer. Mutation of this residue to serine (producing single mutant C14S) yields a wild-type-like enzyme that is resistant to the action of sulfhydryl reagents methylmethane thiosulfonate (MMTS) and 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB). This mutant enzyme was a starting point for probing by cysteine scanning the role of four residues of loop 3 in the catalysis and stability of the enzyme. Considering that the conservative substitution of either serine or alanine with cysteine would minimally alter the structure and properties of the environment of the residue in position 14, we made double mutants C14S/A69C, C14S/S71C, C14S/A73C, and C14S/S79C. Three of these double mutants were similar in their kinetic parameters to wild-type TbTIM and the single mutant C14S, but double mutant C14S/A73C showed a greatly reduced k cat. All enzymes had similar CD spectra, but all mutants had thermal stabilities lower than that of wild-type TbTIM. Intrinsic fluorescence was also similar for all enzymes, but the double mutants bound up to 50 times more 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) and were susceptible to digestion with subtilisin. The double mutants were also susceptible to inactivation by sulfhydryl reagents. Double mutant C14S/S79C exhibited the highest sensitivity to MMTS and DTNB, bound a significant amount of ANS, and had the highest sensitivity to subtilisin. Thus, the residues at positions 73 and 79 are critical for the catalysis and stability of TbTIM, respectively."
738,A monoclonal antibody that inhibits Trypanosoma cruzi growth in vitro and its reaction with intracellular triosephosphate isomerase.,10.1007/s00436-007-0803-5,2007-11-30,[],"In parasites of the order Kinetoplastida, such as Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei, glycolysis is carried out by glycolytic enzymes in glycosomes. One of the glycolytic enzymes is triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), which in T. brucei is localized exclusively in glycosomes, whereas in T. cruzi, the localization of TIM has not been fully ascertained. In the present work, we made a monoclonal antibody (mAb 6-11G) against recombinant T. cruzi TIM (rTcTIM). Incubation of T. cruzi epimastigotes with the mAb inhibited parasite survival. Western blotting showed that the mAb recognized rTcTIM and a 27 kDa band in T. cruzi lysates that corresponded to TcTIM. Sera from patients with Chagas disease recognized rTcTIM and cross-reacted with human recombinant TIM. The cross reactivity between parasite and human TIM possibly contributes to the autoimmune pathogenesis of Chagas disease. Electron microscopy of T. cruzi epimastigotes with the mAb showed that TIM was located within glycosomes, in the cytoplasm, the nucleus, and the kinetoplast. Collectively, the data shed new light on T. cruzi TIM and opens perspectives for drug design."
739,The stability and formation of native proteins from unfolded monomers is increased through interactions with unrelated proteins.,10.1371/journal.pone.0000497,2007-06-07,[],"The intracellular concentration of protein may be as high as 400 mg per ml; thus it seems inevitable that within the cell, numerous protein-protein contacts are constantly occurring. A basic biochemical principle states that the equilibrium of an association reaction can be shifted by ligand binding. This indicates that if within the cell many protein-protein interactions are indeed taking place, some fundamental characteristics of proteins would necessarily differ from those observed in traditional biochemical systems. Accordingly, we measured the effect of eight different proteins on the formation of homodimeric triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei (TbTIM) from guanidinium chloride unfolded monomers. The eight proteins at concentrations of micrograms per ml induced an important increase on active dimer formation. Studies on the mechanism of this phenomenon showed that the proteins stabilize the dimeric structure of TbTIM, and that this is the driving force that promotes the formation of active dimers. Similar data were obtained with TIM from three other species. The heat changes that occur when TbTIM is mixed with lysozyme were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry; the results provided direct evidence of the weak interaction between apparently unrelated proteins. The data, therefore, are strongly suggestive that the numerous protein-protein interactions that occur in the intracellular space are an additional control factor in the formation and stability of proteins."
740,Crosstalk between the subunits of the homodimeric enzyme triosephosphate isomerase.,10.1002/prot.21242,2007-01-16,[],"Homodimeric triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from Trypanosoma cruzi (TcTIM) and T. brucei (TbTIM) are markedly similar in amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure. In their dimer interfaces, each monomer has a Cys15 that is surrounded by loop3 of the adjoining subunit. Perturbation of Cys15 by methylmethane thiosulfonate (MMTS) induces abolition of catalysis and structural changes. In the two TIMs, the structural arrangements of their Cys15 are almost identical. Nevertheless, the susceptibility of TcTIM to MMTS is nearly 100-fold higher than in TbTIM. To ascertain the extent to which the characteristics of the interface Cys depend on the dynamics of its own monomer or on those of the adjacent monomer, we studied MMTS action on mutants of TcTIM that had the interface residues of TbTIM, and hybrids that have only one interfacial Cys15 (C15ATcTIM-wild type TbTIM). We found that the solvent exposure of the interfacial Cys depends predominantly on the characteristics of the adjoining monomer. The maximal inhibition of activity induced by perturbation of the sole interface Cys in the C15ATcTIM-TbTIM hybrid is around 60%. Hybrids formed with C15ATcTIM monomers and catalytically inert TbTIM monomers (E168DTbTIM) were also studied. Their activity drops by nearly 50% when the only interfacial Cys is perturbed. These results in conjunction with those on C15ATcTIM-wild type TbTIM hybrid indicate that about half of the activity of each monomer depends on the integrity of each of the two Cys15-loop3 portions of the interface. This could be another reason of why TIM is an obligatory dimer."
741,Structural differences in triosephosphate isomerase from different species and discovery of a multitrypanosomatid inhibitor.,10.1021/bi0522293,2006-02-24,[],"We examined the interfaces of homodimeric triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from eight different species. The crystal structures of the enzymes showed that a portion of the interface is markedly similar in TIMs from Trypanosoma cruzi (TcTIM), Trypanosoma brucei, and Leishmania mexicana and significantly different from that of TIMs from human, yeast, chicken, Plasmodium falciparum, and Entamoeba histolytica. Since this interfacial region is central in the stability of TcTIM, we hypothesized that it would be possible to find agents that selectively affect the stability of TIMs from the three trypanosomatids. We found that 6,6'-bisbenzothiazole-2,2' diamine in the low micromolar range causes a desirable irreversible inactivation of the enzymes from the three trypanosomatids and has no effect on the other five TIMs. Thus, the data indicate that it is possible to find compounds that induce selective inactivation of the enzymes from three different trypanosomatids."
743,Control of the reactivation kinetics of homodimeric triosephosphate isomerase from unfolded monomers.,10.1021/bi0206560,2003-03-19,[],"Homodimeric triosephosphate isomerases from Trypanosoma cruzi (TcTIM) and Trypanosoma brucei (TbTIM) have markedly similar catalytic properties and 3-D structures; their overall amino acid sequence identity is 68% and 85% in their interface residues. Nonetheless, active dimer formation from guanidinium chloride unfolded monomers is faster and more efficient in TcTIM than in TbTIM. The enzymes thus provide a unique opportunity for exploring the factors that control the formation of active dimers. The kinetics of reactivation at different protein concentrations showed that the process involved three reactions: monomer folding, association of folded monomers, and a transition from inactive to active dimers. The rate constants of the reactions indicated that, at relatively low protein concentrations, the rate-limiting step of reactivation was the association reaction; at high protein concentrations the transition of inactive to active dimers was rate limiting. The rates of the latter two reactions were higher in TcTIM than in TbTIM. Studies with a mutant of TcTIM that had the interface residues of TbTIM showed that the association rate constant was similar to that of TbTIM. However, the rate of the transition from inactive to active dimers was close to that of TcTIM; thus, this transition depends on the noninterfacial portion of the enzymes. When unfolded monomers of TcTIM and TbTIM were allowed to reactivate together, TcTIM, the hybrid, and TbTIM were formed in a proportion of 1:0.9:0.2. This distribution suggests that, in the hybrid, the characteristics of the TcTIM monomers influence the properties of TbTIM monomers."
745,Susceptibility to proteolysis of triosephosphate isomerase from two pathogenic parasites: characterization of an enzyme with an intact and a nicked monomer.,10.1002/prot.10179,2002-07-12,[],"The susceptibility to subtilisin of homodimeric triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei (TbTIM) and Trypanosoma cruzi (TcTIM) was studied. Their amino sequence and 3D structure are markedly similar. In 36 h of incubation at a molar ratio of 4 TIM per subtilisin, TcTIM underwent extensive hydrolysis, loss of activity, and large structural alterations. Under the same conditions, only about 50% of the monomers of TbTIM were cleaved in two sites. The higher sensitivity of TcTIM to subtilisin is probably due to a higher intrinsic flexibility. We isolated and characterized TbTIM that had been exposed to subtilisin. It exhibited the molecular mass of the dimer, albeit it was formed by one intact and one nicked monomer. Its k(cat) with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate was half that of native TbTIM, with no change in K(m). The intrinsic fluorescence of nicked TbTIM was red-shifted by 5 nm. The association between subunits was not affected. The TbTIM data suggest that there are structural differences in the two monomers or that alterations of one subunit change the characteristics of the other subunit. In comparison to the action of subtilisin on TIMs from other species, the trypanosomal enzymes appear to be unique."

In this study, four salt bridge mutants of Trypanosoma brucei brucei TIM were characterized. The folding and stability of the mutants are impaired compared to the wild-type enzyme. This salt bridge is part of a hydrogen bonding network which tethers the C-terminal beta7alpha7beta8alpha8 unit to the bulk of the protein. In the variants D227N, D227A, and R191S, this network is preserved, as can be deduced from the structure of the R191S variant. In the R191A variant, the side chain at position 191 cannot contribute to this network. Also the catalytic power of this variant is most affected."
747,Catalysis and stability of triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei with different residues at position 14 of the dimer interface. Characterization of a catalytically competent monomeric enzyme.,10.1021/bi011950f,2002-03-27,[],"In homodimeric triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei (TbTIM), cysteine 14 of each the two subunits forms part of the dimer interface. This residue is central for the catalysis and stability of TbTIM. Cys14 was changed to the other 19 amino acids to determine the characteristics that the residue must have to yield catalytically competent stable enzymes. C14A, C14S, C14P, C14T, and C14V TbTIMs were essentially wild type in activity and stability. Mutants with Asn, Arg, and Gly had low activities and stabilities. The other mutants had less than 1% of the activity of TbTIM. One of the latter enzymes (C14F) was purified to homogeneity. Size exclusion chromatography and equilibrium sedimentation studies showed that C14F TbTIM is a monomer, with a k(cat) approximately 1000 times lower and a K(m) approximately 6 times higher than those of TbTIM. In C14F TbTIM, the ratio of the elimination (methylglyoxal and phosphate formation) to isomerization reactions was higher than in TbTIM. Its secondary structure was very similar to that of TbTIM; however, the quantum yield of its aromatic residues was lower. The analysis of the data with the 19 mutants showed that to yield enzymes similar to the wild type, the residue must have low polarity and a van der Waals volume between 65 and 110 A(3). The results with C14F TbTIM illustrate that the secondary structure of TbTIM can be formed in the absence of intersubunit contacts, and that it has sufficient tertiary structure to support catalysis."
748,Unfolding of triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei: identification of intermediates and insight into the denaturation pathway using tryptophan mutants.,10.1006/abbi.2001.2749,2002-03-13,[],"The unfolding of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from Trypanosoma brucei (TbTIM) induced by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was characterized. In contrast to other TIMs, where unfolding is a two or three state process, TbTIM showed two intermediates. The solvent exposure of different regions of the protein in the unfolding process was characterized spectroscopically with mutant proteins in which tryptophans (W) were changed to phenlylalanines (F). The midpoints of the transitions measured by circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence, and catalytic activity, as well as the increase in 1-aniline 8-naphthalene sulfonate fluorescence, show that the native state was destabilized in the W12F and W12F/W193F mutants, relative to the wild-type enzyme. Using the hydrodynamic profile for the unfolding of a monomeric TbTIM mutant (RMM0-1TIM) measured by size-exclusion chromatography as a standard, we determined the association state of these intermediates: D*, a partially expanded dimer, and M*, a partially expanded monomeric intermediate. High-molecular-weight aggregates were also detected. At concentrations over 2.0 M GdnHCl, the hydrodynamic properties of TbTIM and RMM0-1TIM are the same, suggesting that the dimeric intermediate dissociates and the unfolding proceeds through the denaturation of an expanded monomeric intermediate. The analysis of the denaturation process of the TbTIM mutants suggests a sequence for the gradual exposure of W residues: initially the expansion of the native dimer to form D* affects the environments of W12 and W159. The dissociation of D* to M* and further unfolding of M* to U induces the exposure of W170. The role of protein concentration in the formation of intermediates and aggregates is discussed considering the irreversibility of this unfolding process."
750,Different strategies to recover the activity of monomeric triosephosphate isomerase by directed evolution.,10.1093/protein/14.3.149,2001-05-09,[],"A monomeric version of triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei, MonoTIM, has very low activity, and the same is true for all of the additional monomeric variants so far constructed. Here, we subjected MonoTIM to directed evolution schemes to achieve an activity improvement. The construction of a suitable strain for genetic selection provided an effective way to obtain active catalysts from a diverse population of protein variants. We used this tool to identify active mutants from two different strategies of mutagenesis: random mutagenesis of the whole gene and randomization of loop 2. Both strategies converged in the isolation of mutations Ala43 to Pro and Thr44 to either Ala or Ser, when randomizing the entire gene or to Arg in the case of randomization of loop 2. The kinetic characterization of the two more active mutants showed an increase of 11-fold in k(cat) and a reduction of 4-fold in K(m) for both of them, demonstrating the sensitivity of the selection method. A small difference in growth rate is observed when both mutant genes are compared, which seems to be attributable to a difference in solubility of the expressed proteins."
751,Factors that control the reactivity of the interface cysteine of triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi.,10.1021/bi002619j,2001-03-22,[],"The amino acid sequences and X-ray structures of homodimeric triosephosphate isomerase from the pathogenic parasites Trypanosoma brucei (TbTIM) and Trypanosoma cruzi (TcTIM) are markedly similar. In the two TIMs, the side chain of the only interface cysteine (Cys14) of one subunit docks into loop 3 of the other subunit. This portion of the interface is also markedly similar in the two enzymes. Nonetheless, Cys14 of TcTIM is nearly 2 orders of magnitude more susceptible to the thiol reagent methylmethane thiosulfonate (MMTS) than Cys14 of TbTIM. The causes of this difference were explored by measuring the second-order rate constant of inactivation by MMTS (k(2)) under various conditions. At pH 7.4, k(2) in TcTIM is 70 times higher than in TbTIM. The difference decreases to 30 when the amino acid sequence of loop 3 and adjoining residues of TbTIM are conferred to TcTIM (triple mutant). The pK(a) values of the thiol group of the interface cysteine of TcTIM and the triple mutant were 0.7 pH unit lower than in TbTIM. Because this difference could account for the different sensitivity of the enzymes to thiol reagents, we determined the k(2) of inactivation at equal levels of ionization of their interface cysteines. Under these conditions, the difference in k(2) between TcTIM and TbTIM became 8-fold, whereas that of the triple mutant to TbTIM was 1.5 times. The substrate analogue phosphoglycolate did not modify the pK(a) of the thiol group of the interface, albeit it diminished the rate of its derivatization by MMTS. In the presence of phosphoglycolate, under conditions in which the interface cysteines of the enzymes had equal levels of protonation, the difference in k(2) of TcTIM and TbTIM became smaller, whereas k(2) of the triple mutant was almost equal to that of TbTIM. Thus, from measurements of the reactivity of the interface cysteine in various conditions, it was possible to obtain information on the factors that control the dynamics of a portion of the dimer interface."

At this interface a critical hydrogen bond is formed between the main chain oxygen atom of the catalytic residue Lys13 and the completely buried side chain of Gln65 (of the same subunit). The sequence of Leishmania mexicana TIM, closely related to Trypanosoma brucei TIM (68% sequence identity), shows that this highly conserved glutamine has been replaced by a glutamate. Therefore, the 1.8 A crystal structure of leishmania TIM (at pH 5.9) was determined. The comparison with the structure of trypanosomal TIM shows no rearrangements in the vicinity of Glu65, suggesting that its side chain is protonated and is hydrogen bonded to the main chain oxygen of Lys13. Ionization of this glutamic acid side chain causes a pH-dependent decrease in the thermal stability of leishmania TIM. The presence of this glutamate, also in its protonated state, disrupts to some extent the conserved hydrogen bond network, as seen in all other TIMs. Restoration of the hydrogen bonding network by its mutation to glutamine in the E65Q variant of leishmania TIM results in much higher stability; for example, at pH 7, the apparent melting temperature increases by 26 degrees C (57 degrees C for leishmania TIM to 83 degrees C for the E65Q variant). This mutation does not affect the kinetic properties, showing that even point mutations can convert a mesophilic enzyme into a superstable enzyme without losing catalytic power at the mesophilic temperature."
753,Derivatization of the interface cysteine of triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi as probe of the interrelationship between the catalytic sites and the dimer interface.,10.1021/bi982425s,1999-04-09,[],"In the interface of homodimeric triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei (TbTIM) and Trypanosoma cruzi (TcTIM), one cysteine of each monomer forms part of the intersubunit contacts. The relatively slow derivatization of these cysteines by sulfhydryl reagents induces progressive structural alterations and abolition of catalysis [Garza-Ramos et al. (1998) Eur. J. Biochem. 253, 684-691]. Derivatization of the interface cysteine by 5, 5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) and methylmethane thiosulfonate (MMTS) was used to probe if events at the catalytic site are transmitted to the dimer interface. It was found that enzymes in the active catalytic state are significantly less sensitive to the thiol reagents than in the resting state. Maximal protection against derivatization of the interface cysteine by thiol reagents was obtained at near-saturating substrate concentrations. Continuous recording of derivatization by DTNB showed that catalysis hinders the reaction of sulfhydryl reagents with the interface cysteine. Therefore, in addition to intrinsic structural barriers, catalysis imposes additional impediments to the action of thiol reagents on the interface cysteine. In TcTIM, the substrate analogue phosphoglycolate protected strongly against DTNB action, and to a lesser extent against MMTS action; in TbTIM, phosphoglycolate protected against the effect of DTNB, but not against the action of MMTS. This indicates that barriers of different magnitude to the reaction of thiol reagents with the interface cysteine are induced by the events at the catalytic site. Studies with a Cys14Ser mutant of TbTIM confirmed that all the described effects of sulfhydryl reagents on the trypanosomal enzymes are a consequence of derivatization of the interface cysteine."
754,Differences in the intersubunit contacts in triosephosphate isomerase from two closely related pathogenic trypanosomes.,10.1006/jmbi.1998.2094,1998-10-08,[],"The aligned amino acid sequences of TIM from Trypanosoma cruzi (TcTIM) and Trypanosoma brucei (TbTIM) have a positional identity of 68%. The two enzymes have markedly similar catalytic properties. Agents that interact with their interface Cys inhibit TcTIM and TbTIM; and those TIMs that lack this Cys (such as human TIM) are largely or completely insensitive to these agents. The susceptibility of TcTIM to the agents is approximately 100 times higher than that of TbTIM. To ascertain the cause of this large difference, the crystal structure of TcTIM was solved at 1.83 A resolution. The two enzymes are very similar homodimers. In TcTIM and TbTIM their respective Cys, 15 or 14, forms part of the dimer interface. In both, the contacts of the Cys with residues of the other subunit are almost identical. Nevertheless, there are noteworthy differences between the two; the existence of glutamine 18 in TbTIM instead of glutamic acid in TcTIM at the beginning of helix 1 decreases the contacts between this portion of the protein and helix 3 of the other subunit. In addition, TcTIM has proline at position 24 in the first helix of the TIM barrel; this is absent in the other TIM. Pro24 disrupts the regular helix arrangement, making the pitch of this helix 1.2 A longer than in TbTIM. When Pro24 of TcTIM was substituted for Glu, the sensitivity of TcTIM to sulfhydryl reagents increased about fivefold, possibly as a consequence of an increase in the space between the first portion of helix 1 and helix 3 of the other subunit. Therefore, it may be concluded that the geometry of the latter region is central in the accessibility to agents that perturb the interface Cys. In human TIM this region is more compact."

The purification steps included: hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, CM-Sepharose, and high performance liquid gel filtration chromatography. The CM-Sepharose material contained two bands (27 and 25 kDa) with similar isoelectric points (pI 9.3-9.5) which could be separated by gel filtration in high performance liquid chromatography. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the porcine TPI detected one single polypeptide on western blot with a molecular weight (27 kDa) identical to that purified from T. cruzi. These antibodies also recognized only one band of identical molecular weight in western blots of several other trypanosomatids (Blastocrithidia culicis, Crithidia desouzai, Phytomonas serpens, Herpertomonas samuelpessoai). The presence of only one enzymatic form of TPI in T. cruzi epimastigotes was confirmed by agarose gel activity assay and its localization was established by immunocytochemical analysis. The T. cruzi purified TPI (as well as other trypanosomatid' TPIs) is a dimeric protein, composed of two identical subunits with an approximate mw of 27,000 and it is resolved on two dimensional gel electrophoresis with a pI of 9.3. Sequence analysis of the N-terminal portion of the 27 kDa protein revealed a high homology to Leishmania mexicana and T. brucei proteins."

Using the numbering system for the T. brucei enzyme, in their aligned sequences, the T. cruzi and leishmanial enzymes have cysteine residues at positions 14, 40, 117 and 126. T. brucei triosephosphate isomerase has cysteine residues at positions 14, 40 and 126, and a valine residue at position 117. Dithionitrobenzoic acid and methylmethane thiosulfonate inhibited the three enzymes, but T. cruzi triosephosphate isomerase was more than 100-fold more sensitive. The sensitivity of wild type triosephosphate isomerase from T. cruzi and T. brucei to the reagents was equal to that of the Cys117Val and Val117Cys mutant enzymes, respectively. Triosephosphate isomerases that have cysteine residues at positions 40 and 126, but lack a cysteine residue at position 14 are insensitive to methylmethane thiosulfonate. Thus, sulfhydryl reagents act on Cys14. At stoichiometric concentrations, the reagents inhibited the three enzymes as a consequence of structural alterations as measured by binding of 8-anilino-1-napthalenesulfonic acid to previously buried hydrophobic regions. However, the times for half-maximal alterations were 10 min, 15 hours and over 30 hours for T. cruzi, T. brucei and L. mexicana triosephosphate isomerase, respectively. The effect of pH on the action of the sulfhydryl reagents and molecular modeling showed no differences in the solvent accessibility of Cys14. As Cys14 forms part of the dimer interface, the data indicate that, in the three enzymes, barriers of different magnitude hinder the interaction between the sulfhydryl reagents and Cys14. The barrier is lower in T. cruzi triosephosphate isomerase which makes its dimer interface more susceptible for perturbation."
758,Reactivation of triosephosphate isomerase from three trypanosomatids and human: effect of suramin.,10.1042/bj3320091,1998-05-13,[],"The reactivation of the homodimeric triosephosphate isomerases (TIMs) from Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, Leishmania mexicana and humans was determined after their denaturation with guanidine hydrochloride. In the range of 2-32 microg of T. brucei TIM per ml and 0.2-5 microg of the other enzymes per ml, the rate and extent of TIM reactivation depended on protein concentration, indicating that at these protein concentrations, the rate-limiting step of reactivation is monomer association and not monomer folding. The rate of monomer association was more than one order of magnitude lower in the T. brucei enzyme than in the other three enzymes. Suramin is a drug of choice in the treatment of sleeping sickness, but its mechanism of action is not known. At micromolar concentrations, Suramin inhibited the reactivation of the four enzymes, but the extent of inhibition by Suramin decreased with increasing protein concentration as consequence of a diminution of the life time of the folded monomer. Since the life time of the monomer of T. brucei TIM is longer than that of the other enzymes, Suramin is a more effective inhibitor of the reactivation of TIM from T. brucei, particularly at monomer concentrations above 1 microg of protein per ml (monomer concentration approx. 37 nM). Compounds that are structurally related to Suramin also inhibit TIM reactivation; their effect was about five times more pronounced in the enzyme from T. brucei than in human TIM."

Degenerate oligonucleotides obtained by reverse translation of conserved polypeptide sequences, derived from TPIs of other organisms, were used to amplify a 450-bp fragment using E. histolytica cDNA as a template. The fragment was used to screen a cDNA library. The isolated cDNA, encoding a protein of 261 amino acids, shares 43-52.6% positional identity with other known protozoan TPIs. The catalytic residues were conserved; nevertheless, several indels occurred at other regions in the protein sequence. The complete coding sequence of the E. histolytica TPI gene was cloned into the expression vector pRSET and expressed as a wild-type TPI enzyme (E. histolytica TPI) and as a fusion protein with an N-terminal tail of six histidine residues E. histolytica TPI-His6); both recombinant proteins were purified. Molecular modeling of E. histolytica TPI showed an identical topology to the known structures of other TPI molecules, but with a remarkable feature; more than 10 inserted residues are located in the same region of the molecular surface. Studies were performed to detect possible changes that might be caused by the inserted amino acids. The catalytic activity and oligomeric state of the purified protein were similar to that reported for TPI from other sources. In contrast, stability towards dilution, as well as thermal inactivation and unfolding assays, showed that E. histolytica TPI is significantly more stable towards denaturation than Trypanosoma brucei TPI."

In T. cruzi, there is only one gene for triosephosphate isomerase. The enzyme has an identity of 72% and 68% with triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania mexicana, respectively. The active site residues are conserved: out of the 32 residues that conform the interface of dimeric triosephosphate isomerase from T. brucei, 29 are conserved in the T. cruzi enzyme. The enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Data from electrophoretic analysis under denaturing techniques and filtration techniques showed that triosephosphate isomerase from T. cruzi is a homodimer. Some of its structural and kinetic features were determined and compared to those of the purified enzymes from T. brucei and L. mexicana. Its circular dichroism spectrum was almost identical to that of triosephosphate isomerase from T. brucei. Its kinetic properties and pH optima were similar to those of T. brucei and L. mexicana, although the latter exhibited a higher Vmax with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrate. The sensitivity of the three enzymes to the sulfhydryl reagent methylmethane thiosulfonate (MeSO2-SMe) was determined; the sensitivity of the T. cruzi enzyme was about 40 times and 200 times higher than that of the enzymes from T. brucei and L. mexicana, respectively. Triosephosphate isomerase from T. cruzi and L. mexicana have the three cysteine residues that exist in the T. brucei enzyme (positions 14, 39, 126, using the numbering of the T. brucei enzyme); however, they also have an additional residue (position 117). These data suggest that regardless of the high identity of the three trypanosomatid enzymes, there are structural differences in the disposition of their cysteine residues that account for their different sensitivity to the sulfhydryl reagent. The disposition of the cysteine in triosephosphate isomerase from T. cruzi appears to make it unique for inhibition by modification of its cysteine."

The structures of homologous enzymes are generally well conserved especially at the active site, but the amino-acid sequences are often very different. We reasoned that if a non-conserved amino acid is fundamental to the function or stability of an enzyme from one particular species, one should be able to inhibit only the enzyme from that species by using an inhibitor targeted to that residue. We set out to test this hypothesis in a model system.
We first identified a non-conserved amino acid (Cys14) whose integrity is important for catalysis in triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from Trypanosoma brucei. The equivalent residues in rabbit and yeast TIM are Met and Leu, respectively. A Cys14Leu mutant of trypanosomal TIM had a tendency to aggregate, reduced stability and altered kinetics. To model the effects of a molecule targeted to Cys14, we used methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) to derivatize Cys14 to a methyl sulfide. This treatment dramatically inhibited TIMs with a Cys residue at a position equivalent to Cys14, but not rabbit TIM (20% inhibition) or yeast TIM (negligible inhibition), which lack this residue.
Cys14 of trypanosomal TIM is a non-conserved amino acid whose alteration leads to loss of enzyme structure and function. TIMs that have a cysteine residue at position 14 could be selectively inhibited by MMTS. This approach may offer an alternative route to species-specific enzyme inhibition."

The interface residue His-47 of wtTIM has been mutated into an asparagine. Ultracentrifugation data show that this variant (H47N) only dimerises at protein concentrations above 3 mg/ml. H47N has been characterised at a protein concentration where it is predominantly a monomer. Circular dichroism measurements in the near-UV and far-UV show that this monomer is a compactly folded protein with secondary structure similar as in wtTIM. The thermal stability of the monomeric H47N is decreased compared to wtTIM: temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) measurements give Tm-values of 41 degrees C for wtTIM, whereas the Tm-value for the monomeric form of H47N is approximately 7 degrees C lower."

Triosephosphate isomerase-related human genetic disorders and comparison with the trypanosomal enzyme.,10.1002/pro.5560030510,1994-05-01,[],"The crystal structure of recombinant human triosephosphate isomerase (hTIM) has been determined complexed with the transition-state analogue 2-phosphoglycolate at a resolution of 2.8 A. After refinement, the R-factor is 16.7% with good geometry. The asymmetric unit contains 1 complete dimer of 53,000 Da, with only 1 of the subunits binding the inhibitor. The so-called flexible loop, comprising residues 168-174, is in its ""closed"" conformation in the subunit that binds the inhibitor, and in the ""open"" conformation in the other subunit. The tips of the loop in these 2 conformations differ up to 7 A in position. The RMS difference between hTIM and the enzyme of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness, is 1.12 A for 487 C alpha positions with 53% sequence identity. Significant sequence differences between the human and parasite enzymes occur at about 13 A from the phosphate binding site. The chicken and human enzymes have an RMS difference of 0.69 A for 484 equivalent residues and about 90% sequence identity. Complementary mutations ensure a great similarity in the packing of side chains in the core of the beta-barrels of these 2 enzymes. Three point mutations in hTIM have been correlated with severe genetic disorders ranging from hemolytic disorder to neuromuscular impairment. Knowledge of the structure of the human enzyme provides insight into the probable effect of 2 of these mutations, Glu 104 to Asp and Phe 240 to Ile, on the enzyme. The third mutation reported to be responsible for a genetic disorder, Gly 122 to Arg, is however difficult to explain. This residue is far away from both catalytic centers in the dimer, as well as from the dimer interface, and seems unlikely to affect stability or activity. Inspection of the 3-dimensional structure of trypanosomal triosephosphate isomerase, which has a methionine at position 122, only increased the mystery of the effects of the Gly to Arg mutation in the human enzyme."

The primary structure of the enzyme has many features in common with that of triose-phosphate isomerase in the related organism Trypanosoma brucei. Their sequences are 68% identical. The residues constituting the subunit interface are highly conserved between the enzyme of L. mexicana and T. brucei, but are mostly different from those in the enzyme of other organisms. One major substitution was detected in the interface region of the L. mexicana protein: a glutamate was found at position 66, instead of glutamine in all other available 20 sequences. The glutamine is thought to be important for the stability of the dimeric enzyme. L. mexicana triose-phosphate isomerase has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Growth conditions were established to obtain high levels of soluble and active protein. The enzyme has been purified to near homogeneity. It appears a stable dimeric protein with a specific activity of 5500 units/mg protein, a subunit mass of 28 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.0. The enzyme has also been partially purified from glycosomes of cultured L. mexicana promastigotes. Some kinetic properties of the recombinant protein have been compared with those of the promastigote enzyme and with the values previously reported for the T. brucei enzyme.

Overexpressed trypanosomal TIM is fully active. The measured physicochemical properties of this recombinant TIM and TIM purified from trypanosomes are indistinguishable. Crystals of recombinant TIM have been grown in the presence of 2.4 M ammonium sulphate under the same conditions as for trypanosomally expressed TIM. The recombinant TIM crystal structure has been refined at 0.23 nm resolution; no differences were detected between this structure and the original crystal structure. A TIM mutant was made in which a unique dimer-interface histidine residue (His47) was changed into an asparagine. This variant ([H47N]TIM) could be expressed and purified to homogeneity by a procedure which was somewhat different from the purification of recombinant wild-type TIM. It is shown that the [H47N]TIM dimer is considerably less stable than wild-type trypanosomal TIM. The catalytic activity of [H47N]TIM is concentration dependent. The dilution-dependent inactivation is reversible. His47 is involved in a water-mediated hydrogen bond with Asp385 of the other subunit. The lower stability of the [H47N]TIM dimer implies that this water-mediated hydrogen bond is important for the stability of the TIM dimer."

Full occupancy binding of the inhibitor is observed only at one of the active sites of the homodimeric enzyme where the flexible loop is locked in a completely open conformation by crystal contacts. There is evidence that the inhibitor also binds to the second active site of the enzyme, but with low occupancy. The hydroxamyl group of the inhibitor forms hydrogen bonds to the side chains of Asn 11, Lys 13, and His 95, whereas each of its three methylene units is involved in nonpolar interactions with the side chain of the flexible loop residue Ile 172. Interactions between the hydroxamyl and the catalytic base Glu 167 are absent. The binding of this phosphonate inhibitor exhibits three unusual features: (1) the flexible loop is open, in contrast with the binding mode observed in eight other complexes between triosephosphate isomerase and various phosphate and phosphonate compounds; (2) compared with these complexes the present structure reveals a 1.5-A shift of the anion-binding site; (3) this is the first phosphonate inhibitor that is not forced by the enzyme into an eclipsed conformation about the P-CH2 bond.

Their effects on the activity of purified triosephosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei and various other organisms have been studied. Using detailed three-dimensional structure information, the first series consisted of both cyclic and linear hydrophilic peptides that were designed to mimic the beta turns of the subunit interface loops of the trypanosome triosephosphate isomerase dimer. None of these exerted any inhibitory effect. The second series consisted of more hydrophobic cyclic peptides, originally designed to inhibit a hepatic transport system. Several of these were very effective in inhibiting the trypanosome triosephosphate isomerase, but not the homologous enzymes from rabbit, dog, yeast or Escherichia coli.

TIM is known to exist in an ""open"" (unliganded) and ""closed"" (liganded) conformation. For chicken TIM only the refined open structure is available, whereas for yeast TIM and trypanosomal TIM refined structures of both the open and the closed structure have been used for this study. Comparison of these structures shows that the open structures of chicken TIM, yeast TIM and trypanosomal TIM are essentially identical. Also it is shown that the closed structures of yeast TIM and trypanosomal TIM are essentially identical. The conformational difference between the open and closed structures concerns a major shift (7 A) in loop-6. Minor shifts are observed in the two adjacent loops, loop-5 (1 A) and loop-7 (1 A). The pairwise comparison of the three different TIM barrels shows that the 105C alpha atoms of the core superimpose within 0.9 A. The sequences of these three TIMs have a pairwise sequence identity of approximately 50%. The residues that line the active site are 100% conserved. The residues interacting with each other across the dimer interface show extensive variability, but the direct hydrogen bonds between the two subunits are well conserved. The orientation of the two monomers with respect to each other is almost identical in the three different TIM structures. There are 56 (22%) conserved residues out of approximately 250 residues in 13 sequences. The functions of most of these conserved residues can be understood from the available open and closed structures of the three different TIMs. Some of these residues are quite far from the active site. For example, at a distance of 19 A from the active site there is a conserved saltbridge interaction between residues at the C-terminal ends of alpha-helix-6 and alpha-helix-7. This anchoring contrasts with the large conformational flexibility of loop-6 and loop-7 near the N termini of these helices. The flexibility of loop-6 is facilitated by a conserved large empty cavity near the N terminus of alpha-helix-6, which exists only in the open conformation."

Stages (3) and (4) are qualitatively guided by force-field calculations. In addition, the designed fragments serve as entries for retrieving existing compounds from chemical databases.

Here we describe the structural properties of this ""flexible"" loop observed in two different structures of trypanosomal triosephosphate isomerase. Trypanosomal triosephosphate isomerase, crystallized in the presence of 2.4 M ammonium sulfate, packs as an asymmetric dimer of 54,000 Da in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Due to different crystal contacts, peptide 167-180 (the flexible loop of subunit-1) is an open conformation, whereas in subunit-2, this peptide (residues 467-480) is in a closed conformation. In the closed conformation, a hydrogen bond exists between the tip of the loop and a well-defined sulfate ion which is bound to the active site of subunit-2. Such an active site sulfate is not present in subunit-1 due to crystal contacts. When the native (2.4 M ammonium sulfate) crystals are transferred to a sulfate-free mother liquor, the flexible loop of subunit-2 adopts the open conformation. From a closed starting model, this open conformation was discovered through molecular dynamics refinement without manual intervention, despite involving C alpha shifts of up to 7 A. The tip of the loop, residues 472, 473, 474, and 475, moves as a rigid body. Our analysis shows that in this crystal form the flexible loop of subunit-2 faces a solvent channel. Therefore the open and the closed conformations of this flexible loop are virtually unaffected by crystal contacts. The actual observed conformation depends only on the absence or presence of a suitable ligand in the active site."

This triosephosphate isomerase is sequestered in the glycosome, a unique trypanosomal microbody of vital importance for the energy-generating machinery of the trypanosome. The crystals contain one dimer per asymmetric unit. The structure could be solved by the method of molecular replacement, using the refined co-ordinates of chicken triosephosphate isomerase as a search model. The positions and individual isotropic temperature factors of the 3792 atoms of the complete dimer have been refined by the Hendrickson & Konnert restrained refinement procedure. While tight restraints have been maintained on the bonded distances, the R-factor has dropped to 23.2% for 12317 reflections between 6 A and 2.4 A. A total of 0.6 mg of enzyme was used for establishing the correct crystallization conditions and solving the three-dimensional structure. Although the sequences of trypanosomal and chicken triosephosphate isomerase are identical at only 52% of the 247 common positions, the overall folds are very similar. The architecture of the active sites is virtually the same with 85% of the side-chains being identical. On the other hand, the residues involved in the dimer contacts are the same at only 55% of the positions. Nevertheless, the position of the local 2-fold axis in the chicken and glycosomal dimers is similar. A remarkable feature of glycosomal triosephosphate isomerase is its high overall positive charge. This extra charge is concentrated in four clusters of positively charged side-chains on the surface of the dimer, quite far away from the active site. These clusters may be involved in the mechanism of import of this triosephosphate isomerase into the glycosome."
778,Kinetic properties of triose-phosphate isomerase from Trypanosoma brucei brucei. A comparison with the rabbit muscle and yeast enzymes.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1987.tb13388.x,1987-10-01,[],"The kinetic properties of Trypanosoma brucei brucei triose-phosphate isomerase are compared with those of the commercially available rabbit muscle and yeast enzymes and with published data on the chicken muscle enzyme. With glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrate Km = 0.25 +/- 0.05 mM and kcat = 3.7 X 10(5) min-1. With dihydroxyacetone phosphate as substrate Km = 1.2 +/- 0.1 mM and kcat = 6.5 X 10(4) min-1. The pH dependence of Km and Vmax at 0.1 M ionic strength is in agreement with the results published for the yeast and chicken muscle enzymes. At ionic strength below 0.05 M the effect of a charged group specific for the trypanosomal enzyme and absent from the yeast and rabbit muscle enzymes becomes detectable. This effect significantly increases Km whereas Vmax becomes slightly higher. Trypanosomal triose-phosphate isomerase is inhibited by sulphate, phosphate and arsenate ions, by 2-phosphoglycolate and a number of documented inhibitors in the same concentration range as are the other triose-phosphate isomerases. The trypanocidal drug, Suramin inhibits T. brucei and rabbit muscle triose-phosphate isomerase to the same extent while leaving the yeast enzyme relatively unaffected."

Here we present our results for triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), which is found exclusively in the glycosome. We found a single TIM gene without introns, having one major polyadenylated transcript of 1500 nucleotides with a long untranslated tail of approximately 600 nucleotides. By a novel method, suitable for low abundance transcripts, we demonstrate that TIM mRNA contains the 35-nucleotide leader sequence (mini-exon) also found on several other trypanosome mRNAs. The TIM gene and a DNA segment of at least 6 kbp upstream of the gene are transcribed at an equal rate in isolated nuclei, suggesting that the gene is part of a much larger transcription unit. The predicted protein is of the same size as TIMs from other organisms and shares approximately 50% amino acid homology with other eukaryote TIMs, somewhat less with prokaryote TIMs. Trypanosome TIM is the most basic of all TIMs sequenced thus far. This is, in part, due to the presence of two clusters of positively charged residues in the molecule which may act as a signal for entry into glycosomes."

Although the overall karyotype was similar, there was much variation in the size of chromosomes between different stocks. Two of three stocks of Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) brucei gambiense had remarkably small mini-chromosomes: 25-50 kilobase pairs compared to 50-150 kilobase pairs for the mini-chromosomes of other Trypanozoon stocks. The relative amount of DNA in the mini-chromosomal fraction of different stocks correlated well with the amount of 177 base pair satellite DNA monomer per microgram nuclear DNA. Hybridisation of Southern blots of pulsed field gradient gels with a number of gene probes showed that the loci for tubulin and phosphoglycerate kinase in Trypanozoon probably lie on the same chromosome, together with some variant surface glycoprotein genes; the genes for triose phosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase are separately located both with respect to each other and the above housekeeping genes. Therefore, there are at minimum three pairs of chromosomes carrying housekeeping genes in Trypanozoon. In some stocks the chromosomes carrying the tubulin and phosphoglycerate kinase genes are split into two bands, suggesting that homologous chromosomes may differ substantially in size in trypanosomes. One Trypanosoma (Nannomonas) congolense stock examined had a similar pattern of chromosome distribution to that of Trypanozoon, but with very small mini-chromosomes (25-50 kilobase pairs.)"

Here, quantitative structure activity relationship, molecular docking and microscopic studies were used to describe the mode of inhibition of selected compounds from the pathogen box PGK and GAPDH.
We identified 4 hit compounds from the pathogen box with optimal binding and chemical interactions.

We have previously identified 2-phenoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone as an inhibitor of both Trypanosoma brucei and human GAPDH. Herein, through multiple chemical, biochemical, and biological studies, and through the design of analogs, we confirmed the formation of a covalent adduct, we clarified the inhibition mechanism, and we demonstrated antitrypanosomal, antiplasmodial, and cytotoxic activities in cell cultures. The overall results lent support to the hypothesis that 2-phenoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone binds the GAPDH catalytic cysteine covalently through a phenolate displacement mechanism. By investigating the reactivity of 2-phenoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and its analogs with four GAPDH homologs, we showed that the covalent inhibition is not preceded by the formation of a strong non-covalent complex. However, an up to fivefold difference in inactivation rates among homologs hinted at structural or electrostatic differences of their active sites that could be exploited to further design kinetically selective inhibitors. Moreover, we preliminarily showed that 2-phenoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone displays selectivity for GAPDHs over two other cysteine-dependent enzymes, supporting its suitability as a warhead starting fragment for the design of novel inhibitors."
793,Evidence for loss of a partial flagellar glycolytic pathway during trypanosomatid evolution.,10.1371/journal.pone.0103026,2014-07-23,[],"Classically viewed as a cytosolic pathway, glycolysis is increasingly recognized as a metabolic pathway exhibiting surprisingly wide-ranging variations in compartmentalization within eukaryotic cells. Trypanosomatid parasites provide an extreme view of glycolytic enzyme compartmentalization as several glycolytic enzymes are found exclusively in peroxisomes. Here, we characterize Trypanosoma brucei flagellar proteins resembling glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK): we show the latter associates with the axoneme and the former is a novel paraflagellar rod component. The paraflagellar rod is an essential extra-axonemal structure in trypanosomes and related protists, providing a platform into which metabolic activities can be built. Yet, bioinformatics interrogation and structural modelling indicate neither the trypanosome PGK-like nor the GAPDH-like protein is catalytically active. Orthologs are present in a free-living ancestor of the trypanosomatids, Bodo saltans: the PGK-like protein from B. saltans also lacks key catalytic residues, but its GAPDH-like protein is predicted to be catalytically competent. We discuss the likelihood that the trypanosome GAPDH-like and PGK-like proteins constitute molecular evidence for evolutionary loss of a flagellar glycolytic pathway, either as a consequence of niche adaptation or the re-localization of glycolytic enzymes to peroxisomes and the extensive changes to glycolytic flux regulation that accompanied this re-localization. Evidence indicating loss of localized ATP provision via glycolytic enzymes therefore provides a novel contribution to an emerging theme of hidden diversity with respect to compartmentalization of the ubiquitous glycolytic pathway in eukaryotes. A possibility that trypanosome GAPDH-like protein additionally represents a degenerate example of a moonlighting protein is also discussed."
794,Toward the development of dual-targeted glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/trypanothione reductase inhibitors against Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi.,10.1002/cmdc.201300399,2014-01-10,"['framework combinations', 'glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase', 'multitarget ligands', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'trypanothione reductase']","A significant improvement in the treatment of trypanosomiases has been achieved with the recent development of nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT). As an alternative to drug combinations and as a means to overcome most of the antitrypanosomatid drug discovery challenges, a multitarget drug design strategy has been envisaged. To begin testing this hypothesis, we designed and developed a series of quinone-coumarin hybrids against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/trypanothione reductase (GAPDH/TR). These enzymes belong to metabolic pathways that are vital to Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi, and have thus been considered promising drug targets. The synthesized molecules were characterized for their dual-target antitrypanosomal profile, both in enzyme assays and in in vitro parasite cultures. The merged derivative 2-{[3-(3-dimethylaminopropoxy)-2-oxo-2H-chromen-7-yl]oxy}anthracene-1,4-dione (10) showed an IC50 value of 5.4 μM against TbGAPDH and a concomitant Ki value of 2.32 μM against TcTR. Notably, 2-{4-[6-(2-dimethylaminoethoxy)-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl]phenoxy}anthracene-1,4-dione (compound 6) displayed a remarkable EC50 value for T.brucei parasites (0.026 μM) combined with a very low cytotoxicity toward mammalian L6 cells (7.95 μM). This promising low toxicity of compound 6 might be at least partially due to the fact that it does not interfere with human glutathione reductase."

The dichloromethane extract of leaves was previously shown to possess growth-inhibitory activities on Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Leishmania mexicana mexicana with low or no cytotoxicity (>100 μg/ml on human normal fibroblasts) (Bero et al. 2009, 2011). In continuation of our investigations on the antitrypanosomal compounds from this dichloromethane extract, we analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS the essential oil of its leaves obtained by hydrodistillation and the major triterpenic acids in this extract by LC-MS. Twenty-seven compounds were identified in the oil whose percentages were calculated using the normalization method. The essential oil, seven of its constituents and the three triterpenic acids were evaluated for their antitrypanosomal activity on Trypanosoma brucei brucei bloodstream forms (Tbb BSF) and procyclic forms (Tbb PF) to identify an activity on the glycolytic process of trypanosomes. The oil showed an IC(50) of 20.9 μg/ml on Tbb BSF and no activity was observed on Tbb PF. The best antitrypanosomal activity was observed for ursolic acid with IC(50) of 2.5 and 6.5 μg/ml respectively on Tbb BSF and Tbb PF. The inhibitory activity on a glycolytic enzyme of T. brucei, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), was also evaluated for betulinic acid, olenaolic acid, ursolic acid, phytol, α-ionone and β-ionone. The three triterpenic acids and β-ionone showed inhibitory activities on GAPDH with oleanolic acid being the most active with an inhibition of 72.63% at 20 μg/ml. This paper reports for the first time the composition and antitrypanosomal activity of the essential oil of Keetia leucantha. Several of its constituents and three triterpenic acids present in the dichloromethane leaves extract showed a higher antitrypanosomal activity on bloodstream forms of Tbb as compared to procyclic forms, namely geranyl acetone, phytol, α-ionone, β-ionone, ursolic acid, oleanolic acid and betulinic acid. The four last compounds were proven to be inhibitors of trypanosomal GAPDH, which may in part explain these antitrypanosomal activities."

800,A monoclonal antibody that inhibits translation in Sf21 cell lysates is specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.,10.1002/arch.20271,2008-10-14,[],"Monoclonal antibody (Mab) 8B7 was shown in a previous study to inhibit protein translation in lysates of Sf21 cells. The antibody was thought to be specific for a 60-kDa form of elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1alpha), primarily because the antigen immunoprecipitated by Mab 8B7 cross-reacted with Mab CBP-KK1, an antibody generated to EF-1alpha from Trypanosoma brucei. The purpose of the current study was to investigate further the antigenic specificity of Mab 8B7. The concentration of the 60-kDa antigen relative to total cellular protein proved insufficient for its definitive identification. However, subcellular fractionation of Sf21 cells yielded an additional protein of 37 kDa in the cytosolic and microsomal fractions that was reactive with Mab 8B7. The 37-kDa protein could be easily visualized by colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250 staining as a series of pI 6.9-8.4 spots on two-dimensional gels. Excision of an abundant immunoreactive spot enabled identification of the protein as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and protein database searching. Subsequent immunoblotting of purified rabbit skeletal muscle GAPDH with Mab 8B7 confirmed the antibody's specificity for GAPDH. Besides the pivotal role GAPDH plays in glycolysis, the enzyme has a number of noncanonical functions, including binding to mRNA and tRNA. The ability of Mab 8B7 to disrupt these lesser-known functions of GAPDH may account for the antibody's inhibitory effect on in vitro translation."

In this study, we show that the first 77 bp of L1Tc (Pr77) (also present in the T. cruzi non-autonomous retrotransposon NARTc, in the Trypanosoma brucei RIME/ingi elements, and in the T. cruzi, T. brucei and Leishmania major degenerate L1Tc/ingi-related elements [DIREs]) behave as a promoter element that activates gene transcription. The transcription rate promoted by Pr77 is 10-14-fold higher than that mediated by sequences located upstream from the T. cruzi tandemly repeated genes KMP11 and the GAPDH. The Pr77 promoter-derived mRNAs initiate at nucleotide +1 of L1Tc, are unspliced and translated. L1Tc transcripts show a moderate half life and are RNA pol II dependent. The presence of an internal promoter at the 5' end of L1Tc favors the production of full-length L1Tc RNAs and reinforces the hypothesis that this mobile element may be naturally autonomous in its transposition."
803,The detection of bovine lactoferrin binding protein on Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1292/jvms.66.619,2004-07-09,[],"Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans, requires transferrin (TF) for growth. Therefore, T. brucei has a TF receptor that allows it to obtain iron from TF. Lactoferrin (LF), a member of the TF family protein, is an iron-binding protein that is found in most biological fluids of mammals. LF has been shown to interact with some bacteria species by specific receptor-ligand binding. We examined the ability of T. brucei to bind bovine LF (bLF) by using a fluorescence test, streptavidin-biotin (SAB) microplate analysis, and far Western blotting using a biotin-streptavidin system. We found that bLF bound to components of T. brucei, and that bLF hydrolysate disrupted the sites responsible for binding to parasite proteins. Furthermore, bLF, human LF, bovine TF, and ovotransferrin bound same proteins of T. brucei, which exhibited molecular masses of 40 and 43 kDa. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 40 kDa bLF binding protein was identified as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)."

Crystal structures of Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania mexicana, and human GAPDH's provided details of how the adenosyl moiety of NAD(+) interacts with the proteins, and this facilitated the understanding of the relative affinities of a series of adenosine analogues for the various GAPDH's. From exploration of modifications of the naphthalenemethyl and benzamide substituents of a lead compound, N(6)-(1-naphthalenemethyl)-2'-deoxy-2'-(3-methoxybenzamido)adenosine (6e), N(6)-(substituted-naphthalenemethyl)-2'-deoxy-2'-(substituted-benzamido)adenosine analogues were investigated.

IC(50)'s of these compounds were in the range 2-12 microM for T. brucei, T. cruzi, and L. mexicana GAPDH's, and these compounds did not inhibit mammalian GAPDH when tested at their solubility limit. To explore more thoroughly the structure-activity relationships of this class of compounds, a library of 240 N(6)-(substituted)-2'-deoxy-2'-(amido)adenosine analogues was generated using parallel solution-phase synthesis with N(6) and C2' substituents chosen on the basis of computational docking scores. This resulted in the identification of 40 additional compounds that inhibit parasite GAPDH's in the low micromolar range. We also explored adenosine analogues containing 5'-amido substituents and found that 2',5'-dideoxy-2'-(3,5-dimethoxybenzamido)-5'-(diphenylacetamido)adenosine (49) displays an IC(50) of 60-100 microM against the three parasite GAPDH's."

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPDH) from the pathogenic trypanosomatids T. brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania mexicana are quite similar to each other, and yet have sufficient structural differences compared to the human enzyme to enable the structure-based design of compounds that selectively inhibit all three trypanosomatid enzymes but not the human homologue. Adenosine analogs with substitutions on N-6 of the adenine ring and on the 2' position of the ribose moiety were designed, synthesized and tested for inhibition. Two crystal structures of L. mexicana glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in complex with high-affinity inhibitors that also block parasite growth were solved at a resolution of 2.6 A and 3.0 A. The complexes crystallized in the same crystal form, with one and a half tetramers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. There is clear electron density for the inhibitor in all six copies of the binding site in each of the two structures. The L. mexicana GAPDH subunit exhibits substantial structural plasticity upon binding the inhibitor. Movements of the protein backbone, in response to inhibitor binding, enlarge a cavity at the binding site to accommodate the inhibitor in a classic example of induced fit. The extensive hydrophobic interactions between the protein and the two substituents on the adenine scaffold of the inhibitor provide a plausible explanation for the high affinity of these inhibitors for trypanosomatid GAPDHs."

The inhibitory effect of these analogues on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPDH) from Trypanosoma brucei (Tb) and rabbit muscle were measured with respect to both substrates, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and 1,3-diPG. Interestingly, all 1,5-diphosphono,2-oxopentanes without substitution at the C-3 position selectively inhibit the Tb GAPDH with respect to 1,3-diPG and are without effect on Rm GAPDH. All 1-phospho,3-oxo,4-phosphonobutanes show themselves to be non-selective inhibitors either with regard to substrates or organisms, but they will be of a great interest as 1,3-diPG stable models for structural studies of co-crystals with GAPDHs."
808,The length of the combined 3' untranslated region and poly(A) tail does not control rates of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA translation in three species of parasitic protists.,10.1128/JB.182.12.3587-3589.2000,2000-06-15,[],"Experimental observations suggested that the length of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA 3' end has a role in regulating rates of translation in the parasitic protists Trypanosoma brucei, Leishmania donovani, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Using a PCR assay for poly(A) tail length, we measured the size of the RNA 3' end under different growth conditions in all three species. Our results showed that the combined 3' untranslated region and poly(A) tail of GAPDH mRNA do not vary with different rates of translation."
810,Comparison and evolutionary analysis of the glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from different Kinetoplastida.,10.1007/pl00006432,1998-12-16,[],"In this work, we present the sequences and a comparison of the glycosomal GAPDHs from a number of Kinetoplastida. The complete gene sequences have been determined for some species (Crithidia fasciculata, Herpetomonas samuelpessoai, Leptomonas seymouri, and Phytomonas sp), whereas for other species (Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma vivax, and Leishmania major), only partial sequences have been obtained by PCR amplification. The structure of all available glycosomal GAPDH genes was analyzed in detail. Considerable variations were observed in both their nucleotide composition and their codon usage. The GC content varies between 64.4% in L. seymouri and 49.5% in the previously sequenced GAPDH gene from Trypanoplasma borreli. A highly biased codon usage was found in C. fasciculata, with only 34 triplets used, whereas in T. borreli 57 codons were employed. No obvious correlation could be observed between the codon usage and either the nucleotide composition or the level of gene expression. The glycosomal GAPDH is a very well-conserved enzyme. The maximal overall difference observed in the amino acid sequences is only 25%. Specific insertions and extensions are retained in all sequences. The residues involved in catalysis, substrate, and inorganic phosphate binding are fully conserved, whereas some variability is observed in the cofactor-binding pocket. The implications of these data for the design of new trypanocidal drugs targeted against GAPDH are discussed. All available gene and amino acid sequences of glycosomal GAPDHs were used for a phylogenetic analysis. The division of the Kinetoplastida into two suborders, Bodonina and Trypanosomatina, was well supported. Within the letter group, the Trypanosoma species appeared to be monophyletic, whereas the other trypanosomatids form a second clade."
811,Selective tight binding inhibitors of trypanosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase via structure-based drug design.,10.1021/jm9802620,1998-11-21,[],"Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from the sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei is a rational target for anti-trypanosomatid drug design because glycolysis provides virtually all of the energy for the bloodstream form of this parasite. Glycolysis is also an important source of energy for other pathogenic parasites including Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania mexicana. The current study is a continuation of our efforts to use the X-ray structures of T. brucei and L. mexicana GAPDHs containing bound NAD+ to design adenosine analogues that bind tightly to the enzyme pocket that accommodates the adenosyl moiety of NAD+. The goal was to improve the affinity, selectivity, and solubility of previously reported 2'-deoxy-2'-(3-methoxybenzamido)adenosine (1). It was found that introduction of hydroxyl functions on the benzamido ring increases solubility without significantly affecting enzyme inhibition. Modifications at the previously unexploited N6-position of the purine not only lead to a substantial increase in inhibitor potency but are also compatible with the 2'-benzamido moiety of the sugar. For N6-substituted adenosines, two successive rounds of modeling and screening provided a 330-fold gain in affinity versus that of adenosine. The combination of N6- and 2'-substitutions produced significantly improved inhibitors. N6-Benzyl (9a) and N6-2-methylbenzyl (9b) derivatives of 1 display IC50 values against L. mexicana GAPDH of 16 and 4 microM, respectively (3100- and 12500-fold more potent than adenosine). The adenosine analogues did not inhibit human GAPDH. These studies underscore the usefulness of structure-based drug design for generating potent and species-selective enzyme inhibitors of medicinal importance starting from a weakly binding lead compound."

The target protein was glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the adenosine part of the NAD cofactor was chosen as lead. After one design cycle and exploiting the selectivity cleft in trypanosomal GAPDH near the C2 of the adenosine ribose, a selective inhibitor, 2'-deoxy-2'-(3-methoxybenzamido)adenosine, was obtained. This compound inhibits human GAPDH only marginally, whereas the enzymes from Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania mexicana are inhibited by 50% at 2.2 and 0.3 mM, respectively. Moreover, the inhibition of the parasite enzyme is 45-fold (T. brucei) or 170-fold (L. mexicana) greater with this substituted analogue than that produced with adenosine."
813,Crystal structure of glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leishmania mexicana: implications for structure-based drug design and a new position for the inorganic phosphate binding site.,10.1021/bi00046a004,1995-11-21,[],"The structure of glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from the trypanosomatid parasite Leishmania mexicana has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The protein crystallizes in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell parameters a = 99.0 A, b = 126.5 A, and c = 138.9 A. There is one 156,000 Da protein tetramer per asymmetric unit. The model of the protein with bound NAD+s and phosphates has been refined against 86% complete data from 10.0 to 2.8 A to a crystallographic Rfactor of 0.198. Density modification by noncrystallographic symmetry averaging was used during model building. The final model of the L. mexicana GAPDH tetramer shows small deviations of less than 0.5 degrees from ideal 222 molecular symmetry. The structure of L. mexicana GAPDH is very similar to that of glycosomal GAPDH from the related trypanosomatid Trypanosoma brucei. A significant structural difference between L. mexicana GAPDH and most previously determined GAPDH structures occurs in a loop region located at the active site. This unusual loop conformation in L. mexicana GAPDH occludes the inorganic phosphate binding site which has been seen in previous GAPDH structures. A new inorganic phosphate position is observed in the L. mexicana GAPDH structure. Model building studies indicate that this new anion binding site is well situated for nucleophilic attack of the inorganic phosphate on the thioester intermediate in the GAPDH-catalyzed reaction. Since crystals of L. mexicana GAPDH can be grown reproducibly and diffract much better than those of T. brucei GAPDH, L. mexicana GAPDH will be used as a basis for structure-based drug design targeted against trypanosomatid GAPDHs."
814,"Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of analogs of 2'-deoxy-2'-(3-methoxybenzamido)adenosine, a selective inhibitor of trypanosomal glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.",10.1021/jm00019a014,1995-09-15,[],"In continuation of a project aimed at the structure-based design of drugs against sleeping sickness, analogs of 2'-deoxy-2'-(3-methoxybenzamido)adenosine (1) were synthesized and tested to establish structure-activity relationships for inhibiting glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Compound 1 was recently designed using the NAD:GAPDH complexes of the human enzyme and that of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness. In an effort to exploit an extra hydrophobic domain due to Val 207 of the parasite enzyme, several new 2'-amido-2'-deoxyadenosines were synthesized. Some of them displayed an interesting improvement in inhibitory activity compared to 1. Carbocyclic or acyclic analogs showed marked loss of activity, illustrating the importance of the typical (C-2'-endo) puckering of the ribose moiety. We also describe the synthesis of a pair of compounds that combine the beneficial effects of a 2- and 8-substituted adenine moiety on potency with the beneficial effect of a 2'-amido moiety on selectivity. Unfortunately, in both cases, IC50 values demonstrate the incompatibility of these combined modifications. Finally, introduction of a hydrophobic 5'-amido group on 5'-deoxyadenosine enhances the inhibition of the protozoan enzyme significantly, although the gain in selectivity is mediocre."

The design was based upon the crystallographically determined structures of the NAD:glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase complexes of humans and Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness. After one design cycle, using the adenosine part of the NAD cofactor as a lead, the following encouraging results were obtained: (1) a 2-methyl substitution, targeted at a small pocket near Val 36, improves inhibition of the parasite enzyme 12.5-fold; (2) an 8-(thien-2-yl) substitution, aimed at Leu 112 of the parasite enzyme, where the equivalent residue in the mammalian enzyme is Val 100, results in a 167-fold better inhibition of the trypanosomal enzyme, while the inhibition of the human enzyme is improved only 13-fold; (3) exploitation of a ""selectivity cleft"" created by a unique backbone conformation in the trypanosomal enzyme near the adenosine ribose yields a considerable improvement in selectivity: 2'-deoxy-2'-(3-methoxybenzamido)adenosine inhibits the human enzyme only marginally but enhances inhibition of the parasite enzyme 45-fold when compared with adenosine. The designed inhibitors are not only better inhibitors of T. brucei GAPDH but also of the enzyme from Leishmania mexicana."
817,Expression in Bacillus subtilis of the glycosomal glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase gene from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0300-9084(92)90037-f,1992-02-01,[],"The cloned T brucei GAPDH gene was inserted within the B subtilis GAPDH gene, carried by pUC18. Upon transformation of B subtilis by this plasmid, not able to replicate in this host, the whole plasmid was inserted in the resident chromosome, presumably by a single recombination event between homologous, chromosomal and plasmid-borne sequences. The heterologous gene was expressed, as revealed by immunological reaction with monoclonal antibodies, recognizing specifically T brucei GAPDH. T brucei GAPDH, having little or no enzyme activity, comprises about 1.56% of cellular proteins. Peptide mapping showed that a fusion of a 7.5-kDa peptide had occurred to the N-terminal part of T brucei GAPDH. This fused protein is presumably the N-terminal part of B subtilis GAPDH, in agreement with the construction of the integrative plasmid."
819,Glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma brucei. Comparison of the glycosomal and cytosolic isoenzymes.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1987.tb10668.x,1987-02-02,[],"Trypanosoma brucei contains two glyceraldehyde-phosphate (GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.12) isoenzymes; one is located in glycosomes and represents 80% of the total activity, whereas the other is present in the cytosol. The purification of the cytosolic GAPDH, which is identical in both bloodstream-form and insect-stage trypanosomes, is described, and the enzyme compared with its glycosomal counterpart. Cytosolic GAPDH is specific for NAD. It is a tetrameric enzyme with subunits of 33.5 kDa, 5 kDa smaller than those of the glycosomal GAPDH. The native enzyme has a pI of 7.9, which is 1.5 pH units less basic than the glycosomal enzyme. Both enzymes display maximal activity at pH 8 but the cytosolic enzyme has a much broader activity profile especially towards lower pH values. Sequence comparison of the first 85 amino acids reveals that the N-terminal parts of both isoenzymes differ by 52%. The N terminus of the cytosolic isoenzyme resembles the corresponding N termini of ten other known GAPDH sequences in that they all lack three amino-acid insertions, which so far only have been found in the glycosomal isoenzyme of T. brucei. This observation explains in part the great difference in subunit size between the two T. brucei isoenzymes and suggests that at least one of these insertions is responsible for import of the glycosomal isoenzyme into the organelle."
821,Two tandemly linked identical genes code for the glycosomal glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1002/j.1460-2075.1986.tb04321.x,1986-05-01,[],"Trypanosoma brucei contains two isoenzymes for glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH); one enzyme resides in a microbody-like organelle, the glycosome, the other one is found in the cytosol. We show here that the glycosomal enzyme is encoded by two tandemly linked genes of identical sequence. These genes code for a protein of 358 amino acids, with a mol. wt of 38.9 kd. This is considerably larger than all other GAPDH proteins studied so far, including the enzyme that is located in the cytosol of the trypanosome. The glycosomal enzyme shows 52-57% homology with known sequences of GAPDH proteins from 10 other organisms, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The residues that are involved in NAD+ binding, catalysis and subunit contacts are well conserved between all these GAPDH molecules, including the trypanosomal one. However, the glycosomal protein of T. brucei has some distinct features. Firstly, it contains a number of insertions, 1-8 amino acids long, which are responsible for the high mol. wt of the protein. Secondly, an unusually high number of positively charged amino acids confer a high isoelectric point (pI 9.3) to the protein. Part of the additional basic residues are present in the insertions. We discuss the genomic organization of the genes for the glycosomal GAPDH and the possibility that the particular features of the protein are involved in its transfer from the cytoplasm, where it is synthesized, into the glycosome."
824,Communication between the nucleotide site and the main molecular hinge of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase.,10.1021/bi800411w,2008-06-11,[],"3-Phosphoglycerate kinase is a hinge-bending enzyme with substrate-assisted domain closure. However, the closure mechanism has not been described in terms of structural details. Here we present experimental evidence of the participation of individual substrate binding side chains in the operation of the main hinge which is distant from the substrate binding sites. The combined mutational, kinetic, and structural (DSC and SAXS) data for human 3-phosphoglycerate kinase have shown that catalytic residue R38, which also binds the substrate 3-phosphoglycerate, is essential in inducing domain closure. Similarly, residues K219, N336, and E343 which interact with the nucleotide substrates are involved in the process of domain closure. The other catalytic residue, K215, covers a large distance during catalysis but has no direct role in domain closure. The transmission path of the nucleotide effect toward the main hinge of PGK is described for the first time at the level of interactions existing in the tertiary structure."
825,Bisphosphonate inhibition of phosphoglycerate kinase: quantitative structure-activity relationship and pharmacophore modeling investigation.,10.1021/jm0604833,2006-12-13,[],"We report the results of a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) and pharmacophore modeling investigation of the interaction of the enzyme 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) with aryl and alkyl bisphosphonates. For the human enzyme, the IC50 values are predicted within a factor of 2 over the 240x experimental range in activity, while for the yeast enzyme, binding of the more flexible alkyl bisphosphonates is predicted within a factor of approximately 4 (over a 2500x range in activity). Pharmacophore models indicate the importance of two negative ionizable features, one hydrophobic feature, and one halogen feature, and docking studies indicate that bisphosphonates bind in a manner similar to the 3-phosphoglycerate molecule identified crystallographically. The results give a good account of the activities of a diverse range of bisphosphonate inhibitors and are of interest in the context of developing inhibitors of glycolysis in organisms that are totally reliant on glycolysis for ATP production, such as trypanosomatid parasites."
826,Probing the limits of the molecular replacement method: the case of Trypanosoma brucei phosphoglycerate kinase.,10.1107/S0907444997010214,2004-08-10,[],"It is of general interest to explore the limits of the molecular replacement method. Described here are the specifics of a successful molecular replacement structure determination in a difficult case: the X-ray crystal structure of a Trypanosoma brucei phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) ternary complex. This ternary complex crystallizes with four 45 kDa subunits in the asymmetric unit, whereas the available search models were all monomers consisting of two distinct domains. Initial molecular replacement attempts using complete subunits were unsuccessful. Attributing this failure to a presumed change in the relative orientations of the N- and C-terminal phosphoglycerate kinase domains, a second attempt was made using each domain as an independent search model. In this way, two N-terminal and then two C-terminal domains could be oriented and positioned in the unit cell. On the basis of this result, a new search model containing both domains in the correct mutual orientation was created and used to identify the two remaining phosphoglycerate kinase subunits. The ability to successfully orient and position an N-terminal domain containing 8.4% of the scattering mass in the asymmetric unit was the key to this structure determination. Further investigations show that a truncated version of this search model containing 5.8% of the scattering mass would have been sufficient for this purpose. A retrospective analysis suggests that the effectiveness of this probe is enhanced by structural conservation, retained temperature factors and a disparity in the degree of order among the various subunits in the T. brucei PGK asymmetric unit. Based on these observations, 231 well ordered Calpha atoms were selected from a single refined T. brucei PGK subunit and it was demonstrated that this collection of atoms, representing just 1.6% of the scattering mass, could be correctly oriented and positioned in the unit cell."
827,Protein conformer selection by sequence-dependent packing contacts in crystals of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase.,10.1002/prot.10469,2004-03-05,[],"In several crystal structures of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), the two domains occupy different relative positions. It is intriguing that the two extreme (open and closed) conformations have never been observed for the enzyme from the same species. Furthermore, in certain cases, these different crystalline conformations represent the enzyme-ligand complex of the same composition, such as the ternary complex containing either the substrate 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and beta,gamma-imido-adenosine-5'-triphosphate (AMP-PNP), an analogue of the substrate MgATP, or 3-PG and the product MgADP. Thus, the protein conformation in the crystal is apparently determined by the origin of the isolated enzyme: PGK from pig muscle has only been crystallized in open conformation, whereas PGK from either Thermotoga maritima or Trypanosoma brucei has only been reported in closed conformations. A systematic analysis of the underlying sequence differences at the crucial hinge regions of the molecule and in the protein-protein contact surfaces in the crystal, in two independent pairs of open and closed states, have revealed that 1) sequential differences around the molecular hinges do not explain the appearance of fundamentally different conformations and 2) the species-specific intermolecular contacts between the nonconserved residues are responsible for stabilizing one conformation over the other in the crystalline state. A direct relationship between the steric position of the contacts in the three-dimensional structure and the conformational state of the protein has been demonstrated."
828,The expression and intracellular distribution of phosphoglycerate kinase isoenzymes in Trypanosoma cruzi.,10.1016/s0166-6851(01)00381-4,2001-11-13,[],"In this paper, we report the subcellular distribution of phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) in epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi. Approximately 80% of the PGK activity was found in the cytosol, 20% in the glycosomes. Western blot analysis suggested that two isoenzymes of 56 and 48 kDa, respectively, are responsible for the glycosomal PGK activity, whereas the cytosolic activity should be attributed to a single PGK of 48 kDa. In analogy to the situation previously reported for PGK in Trypanosoma brucei, these isoenzymes were called PGKA, C and B, respectively. However, in T. cruzi, PGKA seems not to be a minor enzyme like its counterpart in T. brucei. Whereas PGKC behaved as a soluble glycosomal matrix protein, PGKA appeared to be present at the inner surface of the organelle's membrane. After alkaline carbonate treatment, the enzyme remained associated with the particulate fraction of the organelles. Upon solubilization of glycosomes with Triton X-114, PGKA was recovered from the detergent phase, indicating its (partial) hydrophobic character and therefore, a possible hydrophobic interaction with the membrane. The PGKA gene was cloned and sequenced, but the predicted amino-acid sequence did not reveal an obvious clue as to the mechanism by which the enzyme is attached to the glycosomal membrane."
829,A 1.8 A resolution structure of pig muscle 3-phosphoglycerate kinase with bound MgADP and 3-phosphoglycerate in open conformation: new insight into the role of the nucleotide in domain closure.,10.1006/jmbi.2000.4294,2001-02-17,[],"3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a typical kinase with two structural domains. The domains each bind one of the two substrates, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and MgATP. For the phospho-transfer reaction to take place the substrates must be brought closer by a hinge-bending domain closure. Open and closed structures of the enzyme with different relative domain positions have been determined from different species, but a comprehensive description of this conformational transition is yet to be attained. Crystals of pig muscle PGK in complex with MgADP and 3-phosphoglycerate were grown under the conditions which have previously resulted in crystals of the closed, catalytically competent conformation of Trypanosoma brucei PGK. The X-ray structure of the pig muscle ternary complex was determined at 1.8 A and the model was refined to R=20.8% and Rfree=24.1%. Contrary to expectation, however, it represents an essentially open conformation compared to that of T. brucei PGK. In addition, the beta-phosphate group of ADP is mobile in the new structure, in contrast to its well-defined position in T. brucei PGK. An extensive comparison of the ternary complexes from these remote species has been carried out in order to establish general differences between the two conformations and is reported here. A second pair of the open and closed structures was also compared. These analyses have made it possible to define several characteristic changes which accompany the structural transition, in addition to those identified previously: (1) the operation of a hinge at beta-strand L in the inter-domain region which greatly affects the relative domain positions; (2) the rearrangement and movement of helix 8, regulated through the interactions with the nucleotide phosphate; and (3) the existence of another hinge between helix 14 and the rest of the C-terminal part of the chain, which allows fine adjustment of the N-domain position. The main hinge at beta-strand L acts in concert with the C-terminal hinge at helix 7 described previously. Simultaneous interactions of the nucleotide phosphate groups with the loop that precedes helix 8, beta-strand J and the N terminus of helix 13 are required for propagation of the nucleotide effect towards the beta-strand L molecular hinge. A detailed description of the role of nucleotide binding in the hinge operation is presented."
831,Cloning and analysis of the PTS-1 receptor in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/s0166-6851(99)00144-9,1999-12-10,[],"Kinetoplastid organisms, such as the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, compartmentalise several important metabolic pathways in organelles called glycosomes. Glycosomes are related to peroxisomes of yeast and mammalian cells. A subset of glycosomal matrix proteins is routed to the organelles via the peroxisome-targeting signal type 1 (PTS-1). The PEX5 gene homologue has been cloned from T. brucei coding for a protein of the translocation machinery, the PTS-1 receptor. The gene codes for a polypeptide of 654 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 70 kDa. Like its homologue in other organisms T. brucei PTS-1 receptor protein (TbPEX5) is a member of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein family and contains several copies of the pentapeptide W-X-X-X-F/Y. Northern and Western blot analysis showed that the protein is expressed at different stages of the life cycle of the parasite. The protein has been overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The purified protein specifically interacts in vitro with glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinase-C (PGK-C) of T. brucei, a PTS-1 containing protein. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of PGK-C for purified TbPEX5 is 40 nM. Using biochemical and cytochemical techniques a predominantly cytosolic localization was found for TbPEX5. This is consistent with the idea of receptor cycling between the glycosomes and the cytosol."
833,Site-directed mutagenesis of proline 204 in the 'hinge' region of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase.,10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00133.x,1999-03-27,[],"Site-specific mutants have been produced in order to investigate the role of proline 204 in the 'hinge' region of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). This totally conserved proline has been shown to be the only cis-proline in the high resolution crystal structures of yeast, B. stearothermophilus, T. brucei and T. maritima PGK, and may therefore have a role in the independent folding of the two domains or in the 'hinge' bending of the molecule during catalysis. The residue was replaced by a histidine (Pro204His) and a phenylalanine (Pro204Phe), and the resulting proteins characterised by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), circular dichroism (CD), tryptophan fluorescence emission and kinetic analysis. Although the secondary and tertiary structure of the Pro204His protein is generally similar to that of the wild-type enzyme as assessed by CD, the enzyme is less stable to heat and guanidinium chloride denaturation than the wild-type. In the denaturation experiments two transitions were observed for both the wild-type and the Pro204His mutant, as have been previously reported for yeast PGK [Missiakas, D., Betton, J.M., Minard, P. & Yon, J.M. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 8683-8689]. The first transition is accompanied by an increase in fluorescence intensity leading to a hyperfluorescent state, followed by the second, corresponding to a decrease in fluorescence intensity. However, for the Pro204His mutant, the first transition proceeded at lower concentrations of guanidinium chloride and the second transition proceeded to the same extent as for the wild-type protein, suggesting that sequence-distant interactions are more rapidly disrupted in this mutant enzyme than in the wild-type enzyme, while sequence-local interactions are disrupted in a similar way. The Michaelis constants (K(m)) for both 3-phospho-D-glycerate and ATP are increased only by three or fourfold, which confirms that, as expected, the substrate binding sites are largely unaffected by the mutation. However, the turnover and efficiency of the Pro204His mutant is severely impaired, indicating that the mechanism of 'hinge' bending is hindered. The Pro204Phe enzyme was shown to be significantly less well folded than the wild-type and Pro204His enzymes, with considerable loss of both secondary and tertiary structure. It is proposed that the proline residue at 204 in the 'hinge' region of PGK plays a role in the stability and catalytic mechanism of the enzyme."
834,Purification and characterisation of the phosphoglycerate kinase isoenzymes of Trypanosoma brucei expressed in Escherichia coli.,10.1016/s0167-4838(98)00095-8,1998-07-24,[],"The Trypanosoma brucei phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) glycosomal and cytosolic isoenzymes have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near-homogeneity. Both enzymes were similar to the corresponding natural proteins with respect to their physicochemical and kinetic properties. In addition, a mutant of the glycosomal PGK lacking the 20 amino acid long C-terminal extension was overexpressed and purified. Various properties of this truncated glycosomal PGK were examined and it was found that in some aspects the protein behaved quite differently when compared with its natural counterpart. This was notably the case for the apparent Km for 3-phosphoglyceric acid, its sensitivity to inhibitors and its response to salts and guanidine HCl. However, its Vmax was found to be similar to that of the natural glycosomal PGK. These results suggest that the changes in the C-terminus caused a conformational change effecting the 3-phosphoglyceric acid binding site located at the N-terminal domain of the protein."
835,A bisubstrate analog induces unexpected conformational changes in phosphoglycerate kinase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1006/jmbi.1998.1835,1998-06-27,[],"The glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) catalyzes phosphoryl transfer between 1,3-bis-phosphoglycerate and ADP to form 3-phosphoglycerate and ATP. During catalysis, a major hinge bending motion occurs which brings the N and C-terminal enzyme domains and their bound substrates together and in-line for phosphoryl transfer. We have crystallized Trypanosoma brucei PGK in the presence of the bisubstrate analog, adenylyl 1,1,5,5-tetrafluoropentane-1, 5-bisphosphonate, and solved the structure of this complex in two different crystal forms at 1.6 and 2.0 A resolution, obtained from PEG 8000 and ammonium phosphate solutions, respectively. These high resolution structures of PGK:inhibitor complexes are of particular interest for drug design since Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, relies on glycolysis as its sole energy source. In both structures, the inhibitor is bound in a fully extended conformation with its adenosine moiety assuming exactly the same position as in ADP:PGK complexes and with its 5' phosphonate group occupying part of the 1,3-bis-phosphoglycerate binding site. The bisubstrate analog forces PGK to assume a novel, ""inhibited"" conformation, intermediate in hinge angle between the native structures of open and closed form PGK. These structures of enzyme-inhibitor complexes demonstrate that PGK has two distinct hinge points that can each be independently activated. In the ""PEG"" structure, the C-terminal hinge is partially activated while the N-terminal hinge point remains in an open state. In the ""phosphate"" structure, closure of the N-terminal hinge point is also evident. Finally and most unexpectedly, both complex structures also contain a 3 A shift of a helix that lies outside the flexible hinge region. We propose that a transient shift of this helix is a required element of PGK hinge closure during catalysis."
836,Crystal structures of substrates and products bound to the phosphoglycerate kinase active site reveal the catalytic mechanism.,10.1021/bi9724117,1998-04-29,[],"Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) catalyzes the reversible phosphoryl transfer between 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and ADP to form 3-phosphoglycerate and ATP in the presence of magnesium. The detailed positions of the substrates during catalysis have been a long-standing puzzle due to the major conformational changes required for active site formation. Here we report the refined closed form Trypanosoma brucei PGK ternary complex at an improved resolution of 2.5 A, together with the crystal structure of closed form T. brucei PGK in complex with the nucleotide analogue AMP-PNP. In the 180 000 Da asymmetric unit of the ternary complex, four closed form PGK molecules appear to be arranged as two asymmetric dimers. Quite surprisingly, each dimer is comprised of one 3-phosphoglycerate. MgADP.PGK ternary complex and one Pi.MgADP.PGK pseudoternary complex. The substrates in the ternary complex are bound in a fashion nearly identical to that in open form PGK, but a 30 degrees hinge bending conformational change has brought them together and in-line for catalysis. The pseudoternary complex subunits exhibit a similar hinge closure but contain, instead of 3-phosphoglycerate, a single phosphate molecule bound in the active site. This phosphate binds to a site expected for the 1-position phosphate of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, hence providing information for the binding mode for this chemically unstable substrate. The structure of the binary PGK.MgAMP-PNP complex indicates the binding mode for MgATP. An examination of the interactions made by the transferring phosphate groups of the substrate, 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate, and the product, ATP, reveals that in each case only two of the three nonbridging phosphate oxygens are stabilized by hydrogen bonds. In contrast, a model of the transition state phosphoryl group based on all available structural data reveals active site stabilization of all three negatively charged phosphoryl oxygens. These structural models provide insight into the nature of the phosphoryl-transfer reaction catalyzed by PGK and related enzymes."
838,The importance of dynamic light scattering in obtaining multiple crystal forms of Trypanosoma brucei PGK.,10.1002/pro.5560070232,1998-04-01,[],"Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) catalyzes the phosphoryl transfer between 1,3 bis-phosphoglycerate and ADP to form 3-phosphoglycerate and ATP, undergoing significant conformational changes during catalysis. To more precisely document this reaction and the corresponding conformational changes, we have crystallized Trypanosoma brucei PGK in several crystal forms: (1) in the presence of 3-phosphoglycerate and MgADP, PGK crystallizes with four molecules in the asymmetric unit; (2) in the presence of the ATP analog, AMP-PNP, PGK crystallizes in a similar form; (3) in the presence of the bisubstrate analog, adenylyl 1,1,5,5-tetrafluoropentane-1,5-bisphosphonate, PGK crystals grow with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Large scale expression and purification of T. brucei PGK from an E. coli overexpression system was required to obtain sufficient enzyme yields. Results from dynamic light scattering experiments allowed us to identify substrates and analogs which were amenable for crystallization. Ease of crystal growth and diffraction quality for a particular PGK-ligand complex is highly consistent with the apparent monodispersity of the complex in solution as judged by dynamic light scattering. The three-dimensional structures of the various enzyme-ligand complexes are currently being exploited to obtain a better understanding of PGK catalysis, as well as for structure based design of enzyme inhibitors to be used in the development of anti-trypanosomal agents."
839,Characterisation of phosphoglycerate kinase genes in Leishmania major and evidence for the absence of a third closely related gene or isoenzyme.,10.1016/s0166-6851(97)00172-2,1998-03-13,[],"We have characterised the phosphoglycerate kinases (PGKs) in L. major and studied their mRNA and protein expression. Interestingly we have found evidence for only two tandemly linked PGK genes which correspond to the PGK gene B and C homologue in Trypanosoma and Crithidia. The primary structure of the leishmanial PGK genes B and C are virtually identical and differed only by the presence of a 62 amino acid extension at the carboxyl terminal of the PGK gene C homologue which is therefore likely to contain the translocation signal for glycosomal topogenesis. Indeed, the PGK gene C protein was found to be glycosomal (gPGK) while the PGK gene B protein was found to be cytosolic (cPGK). Both PGK genes are expressed in L. major promastigotes with the cPGK transcript expressed at a much higher level (4-5-fold) than the gPGK transcript. Similarly the relative cPGK isoenzyme activity was found to be approximately 4-fold higher than that of the gPGK isoenzyme. Surprisingly in L. major we have found no evidence for the PGK gene A present in all other trypanosomatids studied to date (Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma congolense and Crithidia fasciculata). We therefore consider the possible evolutionary and functional significance of a trypanosomatid with only two PGK isoenzymes."
840,"Organization, sequence and stage-specific expression of the phosphoglycerate kinase genes of Leishmania mexicana mexicana.",10.1016/s0166-6851(97)00152-7,1998-03-13,[],"In Leishmania mexicana two genes were detected coding for different isoforms of the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase. This situation contrasts with that observed in other Trypanosomatidae (Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma congolense, Crithidia fasciculata) analyzed previously, which all contain three different genes coding for isoenzymes A, B and C, respectively. All attempts to detect in L. mexicana a type A PGK, or a gene encoding it, proved unsuccesful. We have cloned and characterized the genes PGKB and PGKC. They code for polypeptides of 416 and 478 amino acids with a molecular mass of 45146 and 51318 Da, respectively. The two polypeptides are 99% identical. PGKC is characterized by a 62 residue C-terminal extension with alternating stretches of hydrophobic and charged, mainly positive amino acids. As in other Trypanosomatidae, PGKB is located in the cytosol, PGKC in the glycosomes. However, Leishmania mexicana distinguishes itself from other trypanosomatids by the simultaneous expression of these isoenzymes: approximately 80% of PGK activity is found in the cytosol and 20% in the glycosomes, both in promastigotes and in the amastigote-like form of the parasite."
842,Synergistic effects of substrate-induced conformational changes in phosphoglycerate kinase activation.,10.1038/385275a0,1997-01-16,[],"Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), a key enzyme in glycolysis, catalyses the transfer of a phosphoryl-group from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP to form 3-phosphoglycerate and ATP. Despite extensive kinetic and structural investigations over more than two decades, the conformation assumed by this enzyme during catalysis remained unknown. Here we present the 2.8 A crystal structure of a ternary complex of PGK from Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness. This structure determination relied on a procedure in which fragments containing less than 10% of the scattering mass were successively positioned in the unit cell to obtain phases. The PGK ternary complex exhibits a dramatic closing of the large cleft between the two domains seen in all previous studies, thereby bringing the two ligands, 3-phosphoglycerate and ADP into close proximity. Our results demonstrate that PGK is a hinge-bending enzyme, reveal a novel mechanism in which substrate-induced effects combine synergistically to induce major conformational changes and, to our knowledge, afford the first observation of the PGK active site in a catalytic conformation."

We demonstrate here that the 3'-untranslated regions of the major cytoplasmic and glycosomal PGK isozymes are capable of conferring the anticipated types of regulation on a transfected reporter gene."
845,Three genes and two isozymes: gene conversion and the compartmentalization and expression of the phosphoglycerate kinases of Trypanosoma (Nannomonas) congolense.,10.1016/0166-6851(94)00208-5,1995-02-01,[],"The glycosome, a microbody organelle found only in kinetoplastid protozoa, compartmentalizes the first six enzymes of glycolysis. In order to better understand the regulation and targeting of glycolytic enzymes in trypanosomes, we have cloned and analyzed the three genes of the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) complex of Trypanosoma (Nannomonas) congolense. The organization of the genes within the complex is similar to that of Trypanosoma brucei brucei. The nucleotide and amino-acid sequences, including those of the novel high-molecular-weight 56PGK, show substantial cross-species similarity. However, the two downstream genes, c1PGK and c2PGK, encode identical isozymes in T. congolense, while they encode distinct glycosomal and cytoplasmic isozymes in T. brucei. Western analysis also indicated that there are only two isozymes in T. congolense and that these are constitutively expressed. Differential digitonin solubilization of the trypanosomes indicated that 56PGK is primarily localized to the glycosome, as expected, and that c1/c2PGK is cytoplasmic. Northern analysis demonstrates that while 56PGK is constitutively expressed, c1PGK and c2PGK mRNAs are differentially expressed in the T. congolense developmental stages. This work demonstrates that T. congolense has only one PGK isozyme, 56PGK, that is predominantly localized in glycosomes."
846,Analysis of a new genetic cross between two East African Trypanosoma brucei clones.,10.1017/s0031182000077799,1994-07-01,[],"Two clones of East African Trypanosoma brucei, with distinct homozygous isoenzyme patterns for one of three enzymes examined, were cotransmitted through the tsetse fly vector Glossina morsitans centralis. Flies with mature infections were individually fed on mice and the subsequent bloodstream from populations analysed for the presence of hybrid trypanosomes by isoenzyme analysis. Several combinations have previously been detected using this approach (Schweizer, Tait & Jenni, 1988; Sternberg et al. 1989). Four clones were isolated from one of the hybrid-containing populations. They showed a hybrid phenotype, as would be expected for the F1 progeny in a diploid Mendelian system. The analysis of the progeny clones, using two gene probes which detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms between the two parental stocks, showed that alleles had segregated at each locus and given rise to three different non-parental combinations of alleles in the hybrid progeny. Characterization of the hybrid progeny clones by PFGE (pulsed field gradient gel electrophoresis) revealed that all progeny clones were recombinant for the intermediate size chromosomes. From the analysis of the segregation of the larger chromosomes, marked by PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase) and CP (cysteine protease) gene probes, it was inferred that the progeny clones did not result from a direct fusion of diploid cells. Results with the PGK probe fit into a classical system with meiosis and subsequent fusion of the nuclei to form diploid progeny. On the other hand, blots with the CP probe as well as some of the ethidium bromide stained PFGE gels revealed the existence of non-parental size chromosomes in some of the hybrid progeny. This phenomenon was observed previously (Gibson, 1989) and further investigation is required to elucidate the mechanism."
847,Differential response to RNA trans-splicing signals within the phosphoglycerate kinase gene cluster in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1093/nar/21.17.4067,1993-08-25,[],"In trypanosomatids, nuclear pre-mRNA splicing is exclusively a trans-splicing reaction in which a capped, 39 nt exon, the mini-exon, is positioned 5' to an open reading frame. Differential RNA splicing might reflect specific mini-exon and 3' splice site interactions. To test this hypothesis, we compared the efficiency of mini-exon addition to three natural 3' splice acceptor sites (SASs) located within a single pre-mRNA transcript. In Trypanosoma brucei, the phosphoglycerate kinase A, B and C genes (PGK A, B and C) are co-expressed as three consecutive sequences on a polycistronic pre-mRNA. This pre-mRNA gives rise to unequal amounts of PGK A, B and C mRNAs. When the SAS from each gene was placed upstream of the luciferase open reading frame and the resultant constructs transiently transfected into T. brucei procyclic cells, luciferase activity levels indicated differential SAS utilization. Enzyme activity was low when the SAS from the A gene was present. Levels were indistinguishable when the B and C SASs were compared. After replacing luciferase with chloramphenicol acetyl transferase in the test constructs, enzyme activities were shown to directly correlate with mRNA amounts. Thus, poor splicing efficiency accounts for the differential expression of the PGK A mRNA during PGK pre-mRNA maturation. This reaction appears to reflect the polypyrimidine pattern within the 3' splice acceptor site."
848,Characterization of a divergent glycosomal microbody phosphoglycerate kinase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(93)90137-m,1993-08-01,[],"There are 3 loci in the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene complex of Trypanosoma brucei. The PGK-A gene product, which we term 56PGK, is targeted to glycosomal microbodies and is highly homologous to the parasite's 2 known PGKs (one cytoplasmic and one glycosomal). However, 56PGK contains an 80 amino acid insertion as well as numerous substitutions compared to the other PGKs. The complementation and kinetic analyses described here demonstrate that 56PGK is an authentic phosphoglycerate kinase--the largest yet described. When expressed in Escherichia coli, 56PGK complements the pgk- phenotype. 56PGK was expressed as a fusion protein and purified to near homogeneity. The Michaelis constants are similar to those of other PGKs, being 0.12 and 2.4 mM for Mg-ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate, respectively. As with other T. brucei PGKs, ATP but not GTP or ITP can serve as a phosphate donor during catalysis. No evidence was obtained for phosphate transfer to atypical substrates. 56PGK shows sulfate inhibition at all concentrations tested, rather than the sulfate activation observed with yeast PGK."
849,A phosphoglycerate kinase-related gene conserved between Trypanosoma brucei and Crithidia fasciculata.,10.1016/0166-6851(92)90245-f,1992-01-01,[],"Trypanosoma brucei and Crithidia fasciculata both contain three different phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) genes, A, B and C, in a tandem array. The genes B and C encode the major PGKs: the cytosolic and glycosomal PGKs, respectively. The PGK-A genes of both Trypanosomatid species encode open reading frames related to PGK, which have most active site residues conserved, but contain an insert of 80 amino acids at approximately position 80 of the 420 amino acids average PGK sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of these inserts is conserved between T. brucei and C. fasciculata (48% positional identity), indicating its functional importance. Although we have not been able to demonstrate PGK activity in the PGK-A gene product, we consider it likely that this gene codes for a minor PGK with special function."
850,A phosphoglycerate kinase-like molecule localized to glycosomal microbodies: evidence that the topogenic signal is not at the C-terminus.,10.1016/0166-6851(91)90193-a,1991-05-01,[],"The phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene complex of Trypanosoma brucei contains three tandemly linked related genes. One gene encodes a cytoplasmic PGK, while another encodes a PGK isozyme localized to glycosomal microbodies. In this communication, we report that the third gene in this complex encodes a 56-kDa molecule which is also localized to the glycosomal core. DNA sequence analysis indicates that this gene contains multiple substitutions and a large insertion in the amino domain, but that it is very similar to the other PGK isozymes in the carboxy domain. The C-terminal tripeptide is identical to that of the cytoplasmic isozyme, and only one conservative change occurs in the last 25 amino acids. The encoded protein, p56, thus contrasts with the many peroxisomal microbody proteins in which the C-terminal tripeptide contains sufficient information for targeting to peroxisomes. Multiple mechanisms may exist for targeting proteins to the protein cores of microbody organelles. Comparisons of the DNA sequences of several alleles suggest that homologous recombination plays a role in the generation of allelic diversity."
851,Genetic exchange in Trypanosoma brucei brucei: variable chromosomal location of housekeeping genes in different trypanosome stocks.,10.1016/0166-6851(91)90029-6,1991-03-01,[],"A Trypanosoma brucei brucei clone from West Africa was crossed with another T. b. brucei clone from the East African kiboko group. This group is defined by characteristic isoenzyme patterns and kinetoplast DNA maxicircle polymorphisms, and is associated with a wild animal-tsetse transmission cycle. Three types of clone were isolated from the cross, 2 of which were hybrid. The hybrids were heterozygotic at 7 loci where the parents were homozygotic and the hybrids also had molecular karyotypes different from those of both parents. Both molecular karyotypes had an extra non-parental band, which was shown to have a different origin in the 2 sets of clones by Southern analysis with various housekeeping gene probes. This analysis also revealed that although the GPI and PGK genes reside on the same chromosome in parent J10, they are on different chromosomes in parent 196. Hybridisation of PFG blots carrying a variety of other trypanosome stocks confirmed that the GPI gene is not always in the same linkage group as the PGK gene cluster. Given that genetic exchange in trypanosomes involves meiosis, such differences in gene linkage will give rise to progeny with incorrect gene dosage, i.e., certain crosses will be partially infertile. This incipient speciation may explain why natural populations of T. brucei spp. are observed not to be in a randomly mating equilibrium."
852,Microbody phosphoglycerate kinase of Trypanosoma brucei: expression and complementation in Escherichia coli.,10.1016/0378-1119(90)90182-q,1990-06-15,[],"In the primitive eukaryotic parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, most of the enzymes of glycolysis are located within microbody organelles called glycosomes. Proteins destined for the glycosome are synthesized on free ribosomes and post-translationally translocated into the organelle. The gene, gPGK, encoding the glycosomal isozyme of phosphoglycerate kinase (gPGK), was cloned adjacent to a T7 promoter and cotransformed with a plasmid encoding T7 RNA polymerase into Escherichia coli Pgk-cells. Functional complementation occurred, but only after the creation of a ribosome-binding site by mutagenesis. This represents the first example of complementation of an E. coli mutant with a gene encoding a microbody protein. Enzymatically active recombinant gPGK was purified to near homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography from highly expressing E. coli. The recombinant protein will aid in studies of glycosomal biogenesis."
853,Elevated phosphoglycerate kinase mRNA but not protein in monomorphic Trypanosoma brucei: implications for stage-regulation and post-transcriptional control.,10.1016/0166-6851(89)90083-2,1989-03-15,[],"Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is present in high levels in the glycosomes of bloodstream stage Trypanosoma brucei, but is virtually absent in procyclic stage glycosomes. Glycosomes isolated from slender and stumpy stage bloodforms show similar levels of PGK, although levels are slightly lower in stumpy forms. Lower levels of glycosomal PGK transcripts are observed in stumpy form RNA, paralleling the decrease in glycosomal PGK activity. Monomorphic strains and pleiomorphic strains show similar glycosomal PGK activity, but monomorphic strains have much higher levels of the glycosomal PGK transcript. In three separate cases, predominantly monomorphic strains derived from highly pleiomorphic strains showed increased levels of glycosomal PGK (gPGK) mRNA. gPGK synthesis rates in monomorphic and pleiomorphic strains were similar, and no significant differences in turnover were observed. These data suggest the possibility of translational control of gPGK protein levels in trypanosome bloodforms. The data also indicate that the metabolism of gPGK mRNA in highly passaged laboratory strains is altered, and counsel caution when attributing differences in transcript levels to stage-specific regulation."
854,Post-transcriptional control of the differential expression of phosphoglycerate kinase genes in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0022-2836(88)90140-4,1988-05-20,[],"The genes for the cytosolic and glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinases (PGK) of Trypanosoma brucei are found in a compact tandem array together with a third PGK-related gene, expressed at low level. Expression of the two PGK genes is differentially regulated in the life cycle of T. brucei: the glycosomal PGK and its mRNA are abundant in the mammalian stage of the cycle but not in the insect stage, whereas the reverse is found for the cytosolic PGK and its mRNA. Nevertheless, our experiments indicate that the mRNAs for both isoenzymes are derived from a common precursor. Nuclease protection experiments using fragments cloned into single-stranded DNA vectors show the presence of low abundance RNA species running through one gene into the next. Indeed minor RNA species larger than the mature mRNAs are visible in overexposed RNA blots. Analysis of nascent RNA in a nuclear run-on assay indicates that the entire PGK gene array is transcribed at an equal rate throughout in both life cycle stages. We conclude that the PGK genes are part of one large multicistronic transcription unit, which is processed to yield the individual mRNAs with concomitant addition of the 5' 35-nucleotide mini-exon sequence, characteristic of all trypanosome mRNAs. It follows that the steady-state levels of the PGK mRNAs are controlled post-transcriptionally."

Here we present the comparison of the genes for the cytosolic and glycosomal PGKs of Crithidia fasciculata, another kinetoplastid organism. The amino acid sequences of the two Crithidia isoenzymes are virtually identical, except for a C-terminal extension of 38 amino acids. We conclude that this extension must direct the glycosomal PGK to the glycosome. The extensions of the Crithidia and Trypanosoma enzymes are both rich in small hydrophobic and hydroxyl amino acids."
856,Biogenesis of glycosomes of Trypanosoma brucei: an in vitro model of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase import.,10.1073/pnas.85.8.2598,1988-04-01,[],"Glycosomes are intracellular, membrane-bound microbody organelles of trypanosomes and leishmania. Nine glycolytic enzymes are the major protein components of the glycosomes of Trypanosoma brucei long-slender bloodstream forms. Glycosomal proteins are believed to be synthesized in the cytoplasm and inserted across the glycosomal membrane posttranslationally. We have developed an in vitro protein import assay for the study of glycosomal biogenesis in T. brucei. All nine glycosomal glycolytic enzymes were detectable by immunoprecipitation and gel analysis of radiolabeled products derived from in vitro translation of total mRNA. Radiolabeled translational products were incubated with purified glycosomes isolated from bloodstream forms and digested with protease to remove proteins not imported into glycosomes. Gel analysis of reisolated glycosomes revealed that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12) and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) (EC 2.7.2.3) were apparently imported intact into the glycosome. Specificity of the protein import assay was verified by using translational products derived from cloned genes encoding T. brucei glycosomal PGK and its 95% homologous cytosolic isozyme. Glycosomal PGK was inserted into the glycosome in vitro with a 27.6% efficiency, but no imported cytosolic PGK was detectable. Preliminary data suggest that certain sequences between the N terminus and residue 123 may be important for import of glycosomal PGK. Our assay, combined with the potential use of genetically altered substrate proteins, may provide the opportunity to explore the recognition systems involved in glycosome biogenesis."

A comparison of the glycosomal and the cytosolic isoenzymes and their sensitivity towards suramin.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1987.tb10667.x,1987-02-02,[],"Trypanosoma brucei has two phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) isoenzymes, one is particle-bound and localized in glycosomes while the other is present in the cytosol. The cytosolic isoenzyme (cPGK) was 900-fold purified from cultured procyclic trypanosomes by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose followed by affinity chromatography on 2',3'-ATP-Sepharose and had a specific activity of 275 units/mg protein. cPGK was compared with the purified glycosomal isoenzyme (gPGK) from bloodstream-form trypanosomes as well as with the commercially available PGKs from yeast, rabbit muscle and Spirulina platensis, a blue-green alga. Like all other PGKs, cPGK was a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of approximately 45 kDa similar to that of the PGKs from other organisms but 2 kDa smaller than that of gPGK. Despite this difference in length and a great difference in isoelectric point, the two trypanosome isoenzymes strongly resembled each other in several respects. The kinetic parameters did not differ significantly from each other or from the PGKs of other organisms. Both trypanosome enzymes resembled the enzyme from S. platensis in that they had an almost absolute requirement for ATP, contrary to the enzymes from yeast and rabbit muscle, which were capable of utilizing GTP and ITP also. This difference in substrate specificity may be related to the amino acid substitutions, Trp 308----His and Ala 306----Glu in the adenine-binding site, which are only found in the two Trypanosoma isoenzymes. Kinetic analysis showed that these substitutions do not prevent binding of the ATP analogues, but probably prevent phosphoryl-group transfer. Both isoenzymes displayed an activity optimum at pH 6.0-9.0 similar to that for the enzyme of yeast. Both gPGK and cPGK were inhibited by the trypanocidal drug Suramin. This inhibition could be described as competitive both with ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate with two inhibitor molecules binding to one molecule of enzyme. The gPGK, however, was much more sensitive (Ki app. = 8.0 microM) to Suramin than either the cPGK (Ki app. = 20 microM) or the enzymes from rabbit muscle (Ki app. = 55 microM), yeast (Ki app. = 167 microM) or S. platensis (Ki app. = 250 microM). It is suggested that positive charges on the enzyme's surface may play an important role in the potentiation of the binding of the negatively charged Suramin molecule."

Comparison of the amino acid sequence of these enzymes reveals 154 invariant positions out of 392 positions in the aligned sequences. Most of the conserved positions fall into the twelve beta-sheets and adjacent peptide regions that form the inner loops surrounding the ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate-binding cleft. The homology between mammalian and yeast PGKs is greater than 94% for the inner-loop region, even though the overall homology is less than 65%. Trypanosome PGK has only 44% overall homology with the mammalian enzyme, but shows 74% homology in the inner-loop region. Trypanosome PGK contains a polypeptide segment in its N-terminal domain that is transposed in comparison with the other species."

Genes B and C are 95% homologous, and the predicted protein sequences share approximately 45% amino acid homology with other eukaryote PGKs. The microbody isoenzyme differs from the cytosolic form and other PGKs in two respects: a high positive charge and a carboxy-terminal extension of 20 amino acids. Our results show that few alterations are required to redirect a protein from cytosol to microbody. From a comparison of our results with the unpublished data for three other glycosomal glycolytic enzymes we infer that the high positive charge represents the major topogenic signal for uptake of proteins into glycosomes."
862,Isoenzyme comparison of Trypanozoon isolates from two sleeping sickness areas of south-eastern Uganda.,10.1016/0001-706x(93)90072-j,1993-11-01,[],"The study characterized 151 Trypanozoon isolates from south-east Uganda by isoenzyme electrophoresis. Stocks were from a range of hosts, including man, cattle, pigs, dogs and Glossina fuscipes fuscipes: 104 isolates were from the Busoga area, 47 were from the Tororo district. Stocks were characterized on thin layer starch gel using eight enzyme systems: ALAT, ASAT, ICD, MDH, ME, NHD, NHI, PGM. Enzyme profiles were generally typical of East Africa; new patterns for ICD and ME were detected. Trypanosomes were classified on the basis of their profile by similarity coefficient analysis and the unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA). The majority of trypanosomes were classified in one or other of two genetically distinct groups which corresponded to the strain groups busoga and zambezi, both of which are associated with Rhodesian sleeping sickness in East Africa. Contingency table analyses indicated associations between certain isoenzymes of ICD and PGM, according to host and geographical origin. Significant relationships between trypanosome strain group and geographic origin were also demonstrated for some host groups."

From isoenzyme information alone, it was possible to classify isolates as to source through the use of linear discriminant functions analysis, with an error rate of only 2% in humans, and 14% over all groups. Differentiation was mostly dependent on patterns in the enzymes ASAT, PEP1, and ICD. Parasites from non-human sources, especially tsetse, were characterized by high isoenzyme diversity, and many unique zymodemes. Observed frequencies of genotypes for ICD, ALAT, and ASAT did not agree with expected frequencies based on random mating of a diploid organism. Deviations were particularly large for tsetse isolates, and were mostly due to a deficiency of one homozygote. Cluster analysis revealed complex relationships among isolates, with patterns evolving through time. Major human zymodemes from the 1970s clustered together with most wildlife isolates from East Africa. This chronic human-wildlife transmission cycle was characterized by ASAT pattern I. Other, minor human zymodemes were associated with a human-cattle transmission cycle characterized by ASAT pattern VII. These original chronic transmission cycles appeared to change in 1980 with the appearance of two new zymodemes in humans. These zymodemes involved changes in ALAT and/or PGM to patterns typical of tsetse and cattle isolates. A resultant epidemic was halted with repeated aerial spraying of endosulfan in 1981. Since then, a variety of new zymodemes of unknown human infectivity have appeared. The origins of these changes are discussed in terms of genetic exchange in tsetse, adaptation to human and cattle transmission cycles, and selection resulting from chronic use of insecticides."

This study examined the potential of plasma Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) in discriminating between early and late-stage patients.
When median NSE levels were compared between early and late-stage patients, results showed a significant (P < 0.02) upregulation among late-stage patients (599.8 ng/mL). No significant differences (P > 0.9) in NSE levels were observed between early-stage patients (300 ng/mL) and controls (454 ng/mL). We used Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves to explore the likelihood of using plasma NSE as a potential stage biomarker in discriminating between early and late-stage HAT patients. Our results showed that NSE demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.702 (95% CI 0.583-0.830). A high staging accuracy for NSE was obtained by using a cutoff of > 346.5 ng/mL with a sensitivity of 68.6% (95% CI 55-79.7%) and a specificity of 93.3% (95% CI 70.2-99.7%). Although our results demonstrate that plasma NSE is upregulated in T. b. rhodesiense sleeping sickness patients, its value in discriminating between late and early-stage patients is limited. However, future studies could consider improving its specificity by combining it with other identified plasma biomarkers."

They are respectively responsible for infectious diseases dourine, nagana and surra. Due to the threat that Trypanozoon infection represents for international horse trading, accurate diagnostic tests are crucial. Current tests suffer from poor sensitivity and specificity, due in the first case to the transient presence of parasites in the blood and in the second, to antigenic cross-reactivity among Trypanozoon subspecies. This study was designed to develop a microsphere-based immunoassay for diagnosing equine trypanosomosis. We tested beads coated with eight Trypanosoma spp. recombinant antigens: enolase, GM6, PFR1, PFR2, ISG65, VSGat, RoTat1.2 and JN2118HU. Of these, GM6 was identified as the best candidate for the serological diagnosis of Trypanozoon infections in equids. Using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis on 349 equine sera, anti-GM6 antibodies were detected with an AUC value of 0.994 offering a sensitivity of 97.9% and a specificity of 96.0%. Our findings show that the GM6 antigen is a good target for diagnosing equine trypanosomosis using a microsphere-based immunoassay.

Consequently, inducible experimentation is reduced to a few laboratory strains. Here we described a new transgene expression system based exclusively on endogenous transcription activities and a minimum set of regulatory components that can easily been adapted to different strains. The pTbFIX vectors are designed to contain the sequence of interest under the control of an inducible rRNA promoter along with a constitutive dicistronic unit encoding a nucleus targeted tetracycline repressor and puromycin resistance genes in a tandem ""head-to-tail"" configuration. Upon doxycycline induction, the system supports regulatable GFP expression (170 to 400 fold) in both bloodstream and procyclic T. brucei forms. Furthermore we have adapted the pTbFIX plasmid to perform RNAi experimentation. Lethal phenotypes, including α-tubulin and those corresponding to the enolase and clathrin heavy chain genes, were successfully recapitulated in procyclic and bloodstream parasites thus showing the versatility of this new tool."

The glycolytic/gluconeogenic enzyme enolase is generally highly conserved, with similar overall fold and identical catalytic residues in all organisms. Nonetheless, potentially important differences exist between the trypanosomatid and host enzymes, with three unique, reactive residues close to the active site of the former that might be exploited for the development of new drugs. In addition, enolase is found both in the secretome and in association with the surface of Leishmania spp. where it probably functions as plasminogen receptor, playing a role in the parasite's invasiveness and virulence, a function possibly also present in the other trypanosomatids. This location and possible function of enolase offer additional perspectives for both drug discovery and vaccination."

To better characterize its properties and guide drug design efforts, we have determined six new crystal structures of the enzyme, in various ligation states and conformations, and have carried out complementary molecular dynamics simulations. The results show a striking structural diversity of loops near the catalytic site, for which variation can be interpreted as distinct modes of conformational variability that are explored during the molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that sulfate may, unexpectedly, induce full closure of catalytic site loops whereas, conversely, binding of inhibitor phosphonoacetohydroxamate may leave open a tunnel from the catalytic site to protein surface offering possibilities for drug development. We also present the first complex of enolase with a novel inhibitor 2-fluoro-2-phosphonoacetohydroxamate. The molecular dynamics results further encourage efforts to design irreversible species-specific inhibitors: they reveal that a parasite enzyme-specific lysine may approach the catalytic site more closely than crystal structures suggest and also cast light on the issue of accessibility of parasite enzyme-specific cysteines to chemically modifying reagents. One of the new sulfate structures contains a novel metal-binding site IV within the catalytic site cleft."

This enolase shares with enolases from other trypanosomatids the presence of three atypical residues, each with a reactive side group, near the active site, already described for the enzyme from Trypanosoma brucei. The natural enzyme was purified, using a three-step procedure, from a cytosolic fraction of L. mexicana promastigotes. The kinetic properties of the purified recombinant enzyme were similar to those of the natural enzyme. Both the recombinant and natural enzyme were inhibited by inorganic pyrophosphate. Subcellular localization analysis after differential centrifugation showed that the enzyme activity is only associated with the cytosolic fraction. However, an apparently inactive form of enolase was detected by Western blots in the microsomal fraction. Digitonin treatment of parasites and immunofluorescence studies with permeabilized and non-permeabilized parasites showed that enolase is also associated with membranes and it was found at the external face of the plasma membrane."

Design of species-specific inhibitors is facilitated by the availability of structural data. Irreversible inhibitors, that bound covalently to the parasite enzyme alone, would be potentially particularly effective. Here we determine the crystal structure of enolase from Trypanosoma brucei and show that two cysteine residues, located in a water-filled cavity near the active-site, are modified by iodoacetamide leading to loss of catalytic activity. Since these residues are specific to the Trypanosomatidae lineage, this finding opens the way for the development of parasite-specific, irreversibly binding enolase inhibitors. In the present structure, the catalytic site is partially occupied by sulphate and two zinc ions. Surprisingly, one of these zinc ions illustrates the existence of a novel enolase-binding site for divalent metals. Evidence suggests that this is the first direct visualization of the elusive inhibitory metal site, whose existence has hitherto only been inferred from kinetic data."

Enolase activity was detected in both bloodstream-form and procyclic insect-stage trypanosomes, although a 4.5-fold lower specific activity was found in the cultured procyclic homogenate. Subcellular localization analysis showed that the enzyme is only present in the cytosol. The T. brucei enolase was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The kinetic properties of the bacterially expressed enzyme showed strong similarity to those values found for the natural T. brucei enolase present in a cytosolic cell fraction, indicating a proper folding of the enzyme in E. coli. The kinetic properties of T. brucei enolase were also studied in comparison with enolase from rabbit muscle and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Functionally, similarities were found to exist between the three enzymes: the Michaelis constant (Km) and KA values for the substrates and Mg2+ are very similar. Differences in pH optima for activity, inhibition by excess Mg2+ and susceptibilities to monovalent ions showed that the T. brucei enolase behaves more like the yeast enzyme. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of T. brucei enolase and other eukaryotic and prokaryotic enolases showed that most residues involved in the binding of its ligands are well conserved. Structure modelling of the T. brucei enzyme using the available S. cerevisiae structures as templates indicated that there are some atypical residues (one Lys and two Cys) close to the T. brucei active site. As these residues are absent from the human host enolase and are therefore potentially interesting for drug design, we initiated attempts to determine the three-dimensional structure. T. brucei enolase crystals diffracting at 2.3 A resolution were obtained and will permit us to pursue the determination of structure."

Clones for the cytosolic enzyme were found in all three organisms, whereas Euglena was found to also express mRNA for a second isoenzyme that possesses a putative N-terminal plastid-targeting peptide and is probably targeted to the chloroplast. Database searching revealed that Arabidopsis also possesses a second enolase gene that encodes an N-terminal extension and is likely targeted to the chloroplast. A phylogeny of enolase amino acid sequences from 6 archaebacteria, 24 eubacteria, and 32 eukaryotes showed that the Mastigamoeba enolase tended to branch with its homologs from Trypanosoma and from the amitochondriate protist Entamoeba histolytica. The compartment-specific isoenzymes in Euglena arose through a gene duplication independent of that which gave rise to the compartment-specific isoenzymes in Arabidopsis, as evidenced by the finding that the Euglena enolases are more similar to the homolog from the eubacterium Treponema pallidum than they are to homologs from any other organism sampled. In marked contrast to all other glycolytic enzymes studied to date, enolases from all eukaryotes surveyed here (except Euglena) are not markedly more similar to eubacterial than to archaebacterial homologs. An intriguing indel shared by enolase from eukaryotes, from the archaebacterium Methanococcus jannaschii, and from the eubacterium Campylobacter jejuni maps to the surface of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme and appears to have occurred at the same position in parallel in independent lineages."

Using as a criterion for a ""structural"" arginine one that forms 4 or more hydrogen bonds to 3 or more backbone carbonyl oxygens, we have used molecular graphics to locate arginines of interest in 4 proteins: Arg 180 in Thermus thermophilus manganese superoxide dismutase, Arg 254 in human carbonic anhydrase II, Arg 31 in Streptomyces rubiginosus xylose isomerase, and Arg 313 in Rhodospirillum rubrum ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Arg 180 helps to mold the active site channel of superoxide dismutase, whereas in each of the other enzymes the structural arginine is buried in the ""mantle"" (i.e., inside, but near the surface) of the protein interior well removed from the active site, where it makes 5 hydrogen bonds to 4 backbone carbonyl oxygens. Using a more relaxed criterion of 3 or more hydrogen bonds to 2 or more backbone carbonyl oxygens, arginines that play a potentially important structural role were found in yeast enolase, Bacillus stearothermophilus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, bacteriophage T4 and human lysozymes, Enteromorpha prolifera plastocyanin, HIV-1 protease, Trypanosoma brucei brucei and yeast triosephosphate isomerases, and Escherichia coli trp aporepressor (but not trp repressor or the trp repressor/operator complex).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

With numerous genomic-scale data of several trypanosomatids becoming available since 2005 (genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes), the scientific community can further investigate the mechanisms underlying these unusual features and address other unexplored phenomena possibly revealing biological aspects of the early evolution of eukaryotes. One fundamental aspect comprises the processes and mechanisms involved in the acquisition and loss of genes throughout the evolutionary history of these primitive microorganisms. Here, we present a comprehensive in silico analysis of pseudogenes in three major representatives of this group: Leishmania major, Trypanosoma brucei, and Trypanosoma cruzi. Pseudogenes, DNA segments originating from altered genes that lost their original function, are genomic relics that can offer an essential record of the evolutionary history of functional genes, as well as clues about the dynamics and evolution of hosting genomes. Scanning these genomes with functional proteins as proxies to reveal intergenic regions with protein-coding features, relying on a customized threshold to distinguish statistically and biologically significant sequence similarities, and reassembling remnant sequences from their debris, we found thousands of pseudogenes and hundreds of open reading frames (ORFs), with particular characteristics in each trypanosomatid: mutation profile, number, content, density, codon bias, average size, single- or multi-copy gene origin, number and type of mutations, putative primitive function, and transcriptional activity. These features suggest a common process of pseudogene formation, different patterns of pseudogene evolution and extant biological functions, and/or distinct genome organization undertaken by those parasites during evolution, as well as different evolutionary and/or selective pressures acting on distinct lineages."

10.1261/rna.2510505",2022-03-22,[],"The parasite Trypanosoma brucei grows as bloodstream forms in mammalian hosts, and as procyclic forms in tsetse flies. In trypanosomes, gene expression regulation depends heavily on post-transcriptional mechanisms. Both the RNA-binding protein RBP10 and glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinase PGKC are expressed only in mammalian-infective forms. RBP10 targets procyclic-specific mRNAs for destruction, while PGKC is required for bloodstream-form glycolysis. Developmental regulation of both is essential: expression of either RBP10 or PGKC in procyclic forms inhibits their proliferation. We show that the 3'-untranslated region of the RBP10 mRNA is extraordinarily long-7.3kb-and were able to identify six different sequences, scattered across the untranslated region, which can independently cause bloodstream-form-specific expression. The 3'-untranslated region of the PGKC mRNA, although much shorter, still contains two different regions, of 125 and 153nt, that independently gave developmental regulation. No short consensus sequences were identified that were enriched either within these regulatory regions, or when compared with other mRNAs with similar regulation, suggesting that more than one regulatory RNA-binding protein is important for repression of mRNAs in procyclic forms. We also identified regions, including an AU repeat, that increased expression in bloodstream forms, or suppressed it in both forms. Trypanosome mRNAs that encode RNA-binding proteins often have extremely extended 3'-untranslated regions. We suggest that one function of this might be to act as a fail-safe mechanism to ensure correct regulation even if mRNA processing or expression of trans regulators is defective."

Consequently, they adapt their metabolic network accordingly. Yet, throughout the life cycles, carbohydrate metabolism - involving the glycolytic, gluconeogenic and pentose-phosphate pathways - always plays a central role in the biology of these parasites, whether the available carbon and free energy sources are saccharides, amino acids or lipids. In this paper, we provide an updated review of the carbohydrate metabolism of the TriTryps, highlighting new data about this metabolic network, the interconnection of its pathways and the compartmentalisation of its enzymes within glycosomes, cytosol and mitochondrion. Differences in the expression of the branches of the metabolic network between the successive life-cycle stages of each of these parasitic trypanosomatids are discussed, as well as differences between them. Recent structural and kinetic studies have revealed unique regulatory mechanisms for some of the network's key enzymes with important species-specific variations. Furthermore, reports of multiple post-translational modifications of trypanosomal glycolytic enzymes suggest that additional mechanisms for stage- and/or environmental cues that regulate activity are operational in the parasites. The detailed comparison of the carbohydrate metabolism of the TriTryps has thus revealed multiple differences and a greater complexity, including for the reduced metabolic network in bloodstream-form T. brucei, than previously appreciated. Although these parasites are related, share many cytological and metabolic features and are grouped within a single taxonomic family, the differences highlighted in this review reflect their separate evolutionary tracks from a common ancestor to the extant organisms. These differences are indicative of their adaptation to the different insect vectors and niches occupied in their mammalian hosts."

This simplified view neglects recently revealed striking compositional diversity of the enzyme and the fact that in specific life stages of some parasites, the physiological role of the enzyme is to maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential at the expense of ATP rather than to produce ATP. In addition, mitochondrial ATP synthases contribute indirectly to the organelle's other functions because they belong to major determinants of submitochondrial morphology. Here, we review current knowledge about the trypanosomal ATP synthase composition and architecture in the context of recent advances in the structural characterization of counterpart enzymes from several eukaryotic supergroups. We also discuss the physiological function of mitochondrial ATP synthases in three trypanosomatid parasites, Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania, with a focus on their disease-causing life cycle stages. We highlight the reversed proton-pumping role of the ATP synthase in the T. brucei bloodstream form, the enzyme's potential link to the regulation of parasite's glycolysis and its role in generating mitochondrial membrane potential in the absence of mitochondrial DNA."

These include regulation of mammalian stage surface antigen variation and surface composition changes between life stages; switching between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation; differential mRNA editing; and changes in posttranscriptional gene expression, protein trafficking, organellar function, and cell morphology. These diverse events are coordinated and controlled throughout parasite development, maintained in homeostasis at each life stage, and are essential for parasite survival in both the host and insect vector. Described herein are the enzymes and metabolites of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) cellular regulatory network, its integration with other cellular regulatory systems that collectively control and coordinate these numerous cellular processes, including cell development and differentiation and the many associated complex processes in multiple subcellular compartments. We conclude that this regulation is the product of the organization of these enzymes within the cellular architecture, their activities, metabolite fluxes, and responses to environmental changes via signal transduction and other processes. We describe a paradigm for how these enzymes and metabolites could function to control and coordinate multiple cellular functions. The significance of the PI system's regulatory functions in single-celled eukaryotes to metazoans and their potential as chemotherapeutic targets are indicated."

However, although many efforts have been made to understand the biochemistry of this parasite, drug development has led to treatments that are of limited efficiency and of great toxicity. To develop new drugs, new targets must be identified, and among the several metabolic processes of trypanosomes that have been proposed as drug targets, carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)) appears as a promising one. As far as the PPP is concerned, a limited number of studies are related to the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. In this work, we have focused on the activity of the second PPP enzyme (6-phospho-gluconolactonase (6PGL)) that transforms 6-phosphogluconolactone into 6-phosphogluconic acid. A lactam analog of the natural substrate has been synthesized, and binding of the ligand to 6PGL has been investigated by NMR titration. The ability of this ligand to inhibit 6PGL has also been demonstrated using ultraviolet experiments, and protein-inhibitor interactions have been investigated through docking calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, a marginal inhibition of the third enzyme of the PPP (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) was also demonstrated. Our results thus open new prospects for targeting T. brucei."

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000416",2018-07-19,[],"The sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei has a complex life cycle, alternating between a mammalian host and the tsetse fly vector. A tightly controlled developmental programme ensures parasite transmission between hosts as well as survival within them and involves strict regulation of mitochondrial activities. In the glucose-rich bloodstream, the replicative 'slender' stage is thought to produce ATP exclusively via glycolysis and uses the mitochondrial F1FO-ATP synthase as an ATP hydrolysis-driven proton pump to generate the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). The 'procyclic' stage in the glucose-poor tsetse midgut depends on mitochondrial catabolism of amino acids for energy production, which involves oxidative phosphorylation with ATP production via the F1FO-ATP synthase. Both modes of the F1FO enzyme critically depend on FO subunit a, which is encoded in the parasite's mitochondrial DNA (kinetoplast or kDNA). Comparatively little is known about mitochondrial function and the role of kDNA in non-replicative 'stumpy' bloodstream forms, a developmental stage essential for disease transmission. Here we show that the L262P mutation in the nuclear-encoded F1 subunit γ that permits survival of 'slender' bloodstream forms lacking kDNA ('akinetoplastic' forms), via FO-independent generation of ΔΨm, also permits their differentiation into stumpy forms. However, these akinetoplastic stumpy cells lack a ΔΨm and have a reduced lifespan in vitro and in mice, which significantly alters the within-host dynamics of the parasite. We further show that generation of ΔΨm in stumpy parasites and their ability to use α-ketoglutarate to sustain viability depend on F1-ATPase activity. Surprisingly, however, loss of ΔΨm does not reduce stumpy life span. We conclude that the L262P γ subunit mutation does not enable FO-independent generation of ΔΨm in stumpy cells, most likely as a consequence of mitochondrial ATP production in these cells. In addition, kDNA-encoded genes other than FO subunit a are important for stumpy form viability."

We detected 288 lysine acetylation sites in 210 proteins of procyclic form, an insect stage of T. brucei, and 380 acetylation sites in 285 proteins in the form of the parasite that replicates in mammalian bloodstream. In T. cruzi insect proliferative form we found 389 ε-lysine-acetylated sites in 235 proteins. Notably, we found distinct acetylation profiles according to the developmental stage and species, with only 44 common proteins between T. brucei stages and 18 in common between the two species. While K-ac proteins from T. cruzi are enriched in enzymes involved in oxidation/reduction balance, required for the parasite survival in the host, in T. brucei, most K-ac proteins are enriched in metabolic processes, essential for its adaptation in its hosts. We also identified in both parasites a quite variable N-terminal acetylation sites.

These parasites are distinctive in that they compartmentalize most of the usually cytosolic enzymes of the glycolytic pathway within a peroxisome-like organelle called the glycosome. Functional glycosomes are essential in both the procyclic and bloodstream forms of trypanosomatid parasites, and mislocalization of glycosomal enzymes to the cytosol is fatal for the parasite. The life cycle of these parasites is intimately linked to their efficient protein and vesicular trafficking machinery that helps them in immune evasion, host-pathogen interaction and organelle biogenesis and integrity. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play important roles in vesicular trafficking and mediate a wide range of protein-protein interactions in eukaryotes. We show here that the SNARE protein Ykt6 is necessary for glycosome biogenesis and function in Trypanosoma brucei. RNAi-mediated depletion of Ykt6 in both the procyclic and bloodstream forms of T. brucei leads to mislocalization of glycosomal matrix proteins to the cytosol, pronounced reduction in glycosome number, and cell death. GFP-tagged Ykt6 appears as punctate structures in the T. brucei cell and colocalizes in part to glycosomes. Our results constitute the first demonstration of a role for SNARE proteins in the biogenesis of peroxisomal organelles."

These organisms compartmentalize glycolysis in essential, specialized peroxisomes called glycosomes. Peroxisome proliferation can occur through growth and division of existing organelles and de novo biogenesis from the endoplasmic reticulum. The level that each pathway contributes is debated. Current evidence supports the concerted contribution of both mechanisms in an equilibrium that can vary depending on environmental conditions and metabolic requirements of the cell. Homologs of a number of peroxins, the proteins involved in peroxisome biogenesis and matrix protein import, have been identified in T. brucei. Based on these findings, it is widely accepted that glycosomes proliferate through growth and division of existing organelles; however, to our knowledge, a de novo mechanism of biogenesis has not been directly demonstrated. Here, we review recent findings that provide support for the existence of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived de novo pathway of glycosome biogenesis in T. brucei. Two studies recently identified PEX13.1, a peroxin involved in matrix protein import, in the ER of procyclic form T. brucei. In other eukaryotes, peroxins including PEX13 have been found in the ER of cells undergoing de novo biogenesis of peroxisomes. In addition, PEX16 and PEX19 have been characterized in T. brucei, both of which are important for de novo biogenesis in other eukaryotes. Because glycosomes are rapidly remodeled via autophagy during life cycle differentiation, de novo biogenesis could provide a method of restoring glycosome populations following turnover. Together, the findings we summarize provide support for the hypothesis that glycosome proliferation occurs through growth and division of pre-existing organelles and de novo biogenesis of new organelles from the ER and that the level each mechanism contributes is influenced by glucose availability."

While the exact nutrient sensor(s) is yet to be identified, deprivation of amino acids, glucose, growth factor and other nutrients can serve as metabolic stimuli to initiate autophagy in higher eukaryotes. In the early-branching unicellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which can proliferate as procyclic form (PCF) in the tsetse fly or as bloodstream form (BSF) in animal hosts, autophagy is robustly triggered by amino acid deficiency but not by glucose depletion. Taking advantage of the clearly defined adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production pathways in T. brucei, we have shown that autophagic activity depends on the levels of cellular ATP production, using either glucose or proline as a carbon source. While autophagosome formation positively correlates with cellular ATP levels; perturbation of ATP production by removing carbon sources or genetic silencing of enzymes involved in ATP generation pathways, also inhibited autophagy. This obligate energy dependence and the lack of glucose starvation-induced autophagy in T. brucei may reflect an adaptation to its specialized, parasitic life style."

They sequester the majority of the glycolytic enzymes and hence are called glycosomes. Their glycosomal enzyme content can vary strongly, particularly quantitatively, between different trypanosomatid species, and within each species during its life cycle. Turnover of glycosomes by autophagy of redundant ones and biogenesis of a new population of organelles play a pivotal role in the efficient adaptation of the glycosomal metabolic repertoire to the sudden, major nutritional changes encountered during the transitions in their life cycle. The overall mechanism of glycosome biogenesis is similar to that of peroxisomes in other organisms, but the homologous peroxins involved display low sequence conservation as well as variations in motifs mediating crucial protein-protein interactions in the process. The correct compartmentalisation of enzymes is essential for the regulation of the trypanosomatids' metabolism and consequently for their viability. For Trypanosoma brucei it was shown that glycosomes also play a crucial role in its life-cycle regulation: a crucial developmental control switch involves the translocation of a protein phosphatase from the cytosol into the organelles. Many glycosomal proteins are differentially phosphorylated in different life-cycle stages, possibly indicative of regulation of enzyme activities as an additional means to adapt the metabolic network to the different environmental conditions encountered."

The mRNAs are differentially edited in bloodstream form (BF) and procyclic form (PF) life cycle stages, and this correlates with the differential utilization of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation between the stages. The mechanism that controls this differential editing is unknown. Editing is catalyzed by multiprotein ∼20S editosomes that contain endonuclease, 3'-terminal uridylyltransferase, exonuclease, and ligase activities. These editosomes also contain KREPB5 and KREPA3 proteins, which have no functional catalytic motifs, but they are essential for parasite viability, editing, and editosome integrity in BF cells. We show here that repression of KREPB5 or KREPA3 is also lethal in PF, but the effects on editosome structure differ from those in BF. In addition, we found that point mutations in KREPB5 or KREPA3 differentially affect cell growth, editosome integrity, and RNA editing between BF and PF stages. These results indicate that the functions of KREPB5 and KREPA3 editosome proteins are adjusted between the life cycle stages. This implies that these proteins are involved in the processes that control differential editing and that the 20S editosomes differ between the life cycle stages."

10.1093/molbev/msr121",2015-06-20,[],"We have previously identified homologs for nearly half of the approximately 30 known yeast Atg's in the genome database of the human sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei. So far, only a few of these homologs have their role in autophagy experimentally confirmed. Among the candidates was the ortholog of Atg24 that is involved in pexophagy in yeast. In T. brucei, the peroxisome-like organelles named glycosomes harbor core metabolic processes, especially glycolysis. In the autotrophic yeast, autophagy is essential for adaptation to different nutritional environments by participating in the renewal of the peroxisome population. We hypothesized that autophagic turnover of the parasite's glycosomes plays a role in differentiation during its life cycle, which demands adaptation to different host environments and associated dramatic changes in nutritional conditions. We therefore characterized T. brucei ATG24, the T. brucei ortholog of yeast Atg24 and mammalian SNX4, and found it to have a regulatory role in autophagy and differentiation as well as endocytic trafficking. ATG24 partially localized on endocytic membranes where it was recruited via PI3-kinase III/VPS34. ATG24 silencing severely impaired receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin, but not adsorptive uptake of a lectin, and caused a major enlargement of the flagellar pocket. ATG24 silencing approximately doubled the number of autophagosomes, suggesting a role in repressing autophagy, and strongly accelerated differentiation, in accordance with a role of autophagy in parasite differentiation. Overexpression of the two isoforms of T. brucei ATG8 fused to GFP slowed down differentiation, possibly by a dominant-negative effect. This was overcome by ATG24 depletion, further supporting its regulatory role."

Owing to the low abundance of glucose in the insect vector (tsetse flies) the parasites are dependent upon a fully functional mitochondrion, capable of performing oxidative phosphorylation. Nevertheless, inside the mammalian host (bloodstream forms), which is rich in nutrients, parasite proliferation relies on glycolysis, and the mitochondrion is partially redundant. In this work we perform a comparative study of the mitochondrial genome (kinetoplast) in different strains of Trypanosoma vivax. The comparison was conducted between a West African strain that goes through a complete life cycle and two American strains that are mechanically transmitted (by different vectors) and remain as bloodstream forms only. It was found that while the African strain has a complete and apparently fully functional kinetoplast, the American T. vivax strains have undergone a drastic process of mitochondrial genome degradation, in spite of the recent introduction of these parasites in America. Many of their genes exhibit different types of mutations that are disruptive of function such as major deletions, frameshift causing indels and missense mutations. Moreover, all but three genes (A6-ATPase, RPS12 and MURF2) are not edited in the American strains, whereas editing takes place normally in all (editable) genes from the African strain. Two of these genes, A6-ATPase and RPS12, are known to play an essential function during bloodstream stage. Analysis of the minicircle population shows that its diversity has been greatly reduced, remaining mostly those minicircles that carry guide RNAs necessary for the editing of A6-ATPase and RPS12. The fact that these two genes remain functioning normally, as opposed to that reported in Trypanosoma brucei-like trypanosomes that restrict their life cycle to the bloodstream forms, along with other differences, is indicative that the American T. vivax strains are following a novel evolutionary pathway."

The bloodstream form (BF) of T. brucei lacks a functional Krebs cycle and relies exclusively on glycolysis for ATP production. Despite the lack of a functional Krebs cycle, α-KDE1 was expressed in BF T. brucei and RNA interference knockdown of α-KDE1 mRNA resulted in rapid growth arrest and killing. Cell death was preceded by progressive swelling of the flagellar pocket as a consequence of recruitment of both flagellar and plasma membranes into the pocket. BF T. brucei expressing an epitope-tagged copy of α-KDE1 showed localization to glycosomes and not the mitochondrion. We used a cell line transfected with a reporter construct containing the N-terminal sequence of α-KDE1 fused to green fluorescent protein to examine the requirements for glycosome targeting. We found that the N-terminal 18 amino acids of α-KDE1 contain overlapping mitochondrion- and peroxisome-targeting sequences and are sufficient to direct localization to the glycosome in BF T. brucei. These results suggest that α-KDE1 has a novel moonlighting function outside the mitochondrion in BF T. brucei."
987,Using fluorescent proteins to monitor glycosome dynamics in the African trypanosome.,10.3791/51647,2014-09-02,[],"Trypanosoma brucei is a kinetoplastid parasite that causes human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, and a wasting disease, nagana, in cattle. The parasite alternates between the bloodstream of the mammalian host and the tsetse fly vector. The composition of many cellular organelles changes in response to these different extracellular conditions. Glycosomes are highly specialized peroxisomes in which many of the enzymes involved in glycolysis are compartmentalized. Glycosome composition changes in a developmental and environmentally regulated manner. Currently, the most common techniques used to study glycosome dynamics are electron and fluorescence microscopy; techniques that are expensive, time and labor intensive, and not easily adapted to high throughput analyses. To overcome these limitations, a fluorescent-glycosome reporter system in which enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) is fused to a peroxisome targeting sequence (PTS2), which directs the fusion protein to glycosomes, has been established. Upon import of the PTS2eYFP fusion protein, glycosomes become fluorescent. Organelle degradation and recycling results in the loss of fluorescence that can be measured by flow cytometry. Large numbers of cells (5,000 cells/sec) can be analyzed in real-time without extensive sample preparation such as fixation and mounting. This method offers a rapid way of detecting changes in organelle composition in response to fluctuating environmental conditions."

With the exception of some potential transporters for fatty acids, and one member of the mitochondrial carrier protein family, proteins that transport metabolites across the glycosomal membrane have yet to be identified. We show here that the phosphatidylcholine species composition of Trypanosoma brucei glycosomal membranes resembles that of other cellular membranes, which means that glycosomal membranes are expected to be impermeable to small hydrophilic molecules unless transport is facilitated by specialized membrane proteins. Further, we identified 464 proteins in a glycosomal membrane preparation from Leishmania tarentolae. The proteins included approximately 40 glycosomal matrix proteins, and homologues of peroxisomal membrane proteins - PEX11, GIM5A and GIM5B; PXMP4, PEX2 and PEX16 - as well as the transporters GAT1 and GAT3. There were 27 other proteins that could not be unambiguously assigned to other compartments, and that had predicted trans-membrane domains. However, no clear candidates for transport of the major substrates and intermediates of energy metabolism were found. We suggest that, instead, these metabolites are transported via pores formed by the known glycosomal membrane proteins."

A model of glycolysis in the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis, Trypanosoma brucei, has already shown the utility of this approach. Here we add the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) of T. brucei to the glycolytic model. The PPP is localized to both the cytosol and the glycosome and adding it to the glycolytic model without further adjustments leads to a draining of the essential bound-phosphate moiety within the glycosome. This phosphate ""leak"" must be resolved for the model to be a reasonable representation of parasite physiology. Two main types of theoretical solution to the problem could be identified: (i) including additional enzymatic reactions in the glycosome, or (ii) adding a mechanism to transfer bound phosphates between cytosol and glycosome. One example of the first type of solution would be the presence of a glycosomal ribokinase to regenerate ATP from ribose 5-phosphate and ADP. Experimental characterization of ribokinase in T. brucei showed that very low enzyme levels are sufficient for parasite survival, indicating that other mechanisms are required in controlling the phosphate leak. Examples of the second type would involve the presence of an ATP:ADP exchanger or recently described permeability pores in the glycosomal membrane, although the current absence of identified genes encoding such molecules impedes experimental testing by genetic manipulation. Confronted with this uncertainty, we present a modeling strategy that identifies robust predictions in the context of incomplete system characterization. We illustrate this strategy by exploring the mechanism underlying the essential function of one of the PPP enzymes, and validate it by confirming the model predictions experimentally."
998,Examination of the mode of action of the almiramide family of natural products against the kinetoplastid parasite Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1021/np300834q,2013-03-01,[],"Almiramide C is a marine natural product with low micromolar activity against Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of leishmaniasis. We have now shown that almiramide C is also active against the related parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis. A series of activity-based probes have been synthesized to explore both the molecular target of this compound series in T. brucei lysates and site localization through epifluorescence microscopy. These target identification studies indicate that the almiramides likely perturb glycosomal function through disruption of membrane assembly machinery. Glycosomes, which are organelles specific to kinetoplastid parasites, house the first seven steps of glycolysis and have been shown to be essential for parasite survival in the bloodstream stage. There are currently no reported small-molecule disruptors of glycosome function, making the almiramides unique molecular probes for this understudied parasite-specific organelle. Additionally, examination of toxicity in an in vivo zebrafish model has shown that these compounds have little effect on organism development, even at high concentrations, and has uncovered a potential side effect through localization of fluorescent derivatives to zebrafish neuromast cells. Combined, these results further our understanding of the potential value of this lead series as development candidates against T. brucei."
999,Processing of the glycosomal matrix-protein import receptor PEX5 of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.12.075,2012-12-26,[],"Glycolysis in kinetoplastid protists such as Trypanosoma brucei is compartmentalized in peroxisome-like organelles called glycosomes. Glycosomal matrix-protein import involves a cytosolic receptor, PEX5, which recognizes the peroxisomal-targeting signal type 1 (PTS1) present at the C-terminus of the majority of matrix proteins. PEX5 appears generally susceptible to in vitro proteolytic processing. On western blots of T. brucei, two PEX5 forms are detected with apparent M(r) of 100kDa and 72kDa. 5'-RACE-PCR showed that TbPEX5 is encoded by a unique transcript that can be translated into a protein of maximally 72kDa. However, recombinant PEX5 migrates aberrantly in SDS-PAGE with an apparent M(r) of 100kDa, similarly as observed for the native peroxin. In vitro protease susceptibility analysis of native and (35)S-labelled PEX5 showed truncation of the 100kDa form at the N-terminal side by unknown parasite proteases, giving rise to the 72kDa form which remains functional for PTS1 binding. The relevance of these observations is discussed."
1000,Flux Analysis of the Trypanosoma brucei Glycolysis Based on a Multiobjective-Criteria Bioinformatic Approach.,10.1155/2012/159423,2012-10-26,[],"Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite of major of interest in discovering new genes for drug targets. This parasite alternates its life cycle between the mammal host(s) (bloodstream form) and the insect vector (procyclic form), with two divergent glucose metabolism amenable to in vitro culture. While the metabolic network of the bloodstream forms has been well characterized, the flux distribution between the different branches of the glucose metabolic network in the procyclic form has not been addressed so far. We present a computational analysis (called Metaboflux) that exploits the metabolic topology of the procyclic form, and allows the incorporation of multipurpose experimental data to increase the biological relevance of the model. The alternatives resulting from the structural complexity of networks are formulated as an optimization problem solved by a metaheuristic where experimental data are modeled in a multiobjective function. Our results show that the current metabolic model is in agreement with experimental data and confirms the observed high metabolic flexibility of glucose metabolism. In addition, Metaboflux offers a rational explanation for the high flexibility in the ratio between final products from glucose metabolism, thsat is, flux redistribution through the malic enzyme steps."

In order to model a biochemical reaction network in a non-equilibrium state one requires a mathematical formulation to mimic this forcing. We provide a general formulation to force an arbitrary large kinetic model in a manner that is still consistent with the existence of a non-equilibrium steady state. We can guarantee the existence of a non-equilibrium steady state assuming only two conditions; that every reaction is mass balanced and that continuous kinetic reaction rate laws never lead to a negative molecule concentration. These conditions can be verified in polynomial time and are flexible enough to permit one to force a system away from equilibrium. With expository biochemical examples we show how reversible, mass balanced perpetual reaction(s), with thermodynamically infeasible kinetic parameters, can be used to perpetually force various kinetic models in a manner consistent with the existence of a steady state. Easily testable existence conditions are foundational for efforts to reliably compute non-equilibrium steady states in genome-scale biochemical kinetic models."

10.1016/j.bbadis.2011.12.011",2012-04-17,[],"Glycosomes are a specialized form of peroxisomes (microbodies) present in unicellular eukaryotes that belong to the Kinetoplastea order, such as Trypanosoma and Leishmania species, parasitic protists causing severe diseases of livestock and humans in subtropical and tropical countries. The organelles harbour most enzymes of the glycolytic pathway that is responsible for substrate-level ATP production in the cell. Glycolysis is essential for bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei and enzymes comprising this pathway have been validated as drug targets. Glycosomes are surrounded by a single membrane. How glycolytic metabolites are transported across the glycosomal membrane is unclear.
We hypothesized that glycosomal membrane, similarly to membranes of yeast and mammalian peroxisomes, contains channel-forming proteins involved in the selective transfer of metabolites. To verify this prediction, we isolated a glycosomal fraction from bloodstream-form T. brucei and reconstituted solubilized membrane proteins into planar lipid bilayers. The electrophysiological characteristics of the channels were studied using multiple channel recording and single channel analysis. Three main channel-forming activities were detected with current amplitudes 70-80 pA, 20-25 pA, and 8-11 pA, respectively (holding potential +10 mV and 3.0 M KCl as an electrolyte). All channels were in fully open state in a range of voltages ±150 mV and showed no sub-conductance transitions. The channel with current amplitude 20-25 pA is anion-selective (P(K+)/P(Cl-)∼0.31), while the other two types of channels are slightly selective for cations (P(K+)/P(Cl-) ratios ∼1.15 and ∼1.27 for the high- and low-conductance channels, respectively). The anion-selective channel showed an intrinsic current rectification that may suggest a functional asymmetry of the channel's pore.
These results indicate that the membrane of glycosomes apparently contains several types of pore-forming channels connecting the glycosomal lumen and the cytosol."
1010,High-throughput phenotyping using parallel sequencing of RNA interference targets in the African trypanosome.,10.1101/gr.115089.110,2011-03-03,[],"African trypanosomes are major pathogens of humans and livestock and represent a model for studies of unusual protozoal biology. We describe a high-throughput phenotyping approach termed RNA interference (RNAi) target sequencing, or RIT-seq that, using Illumina sequencing, maps fitness-costs associated with RNAi. We scored the abundance of >90,000 integrated RNAi targets recovered from trypanosome libraries before and after induction of RNAi. Data are presented for 7435 protein coding sequences, >99% of a non-redundant set in the Trypanosoma brucei genome. Analysis of bloodstream and insect life-cycle stages and differentiated libraries revealed genome-scale knockdown profiles of growth and development, linking thousands of previously uncharacterized and ""hypothetical"" genes to essential functions. Genes underlying prominent features of trypanosome biology are highlighted, including the constitutive emphasis on post-transcriptional gene expression control, the importance of flagellar motility and glycolysis in the bloodstream, and of carboxylic acid metabolism and phosphorylation during differentiation from the bloodstream to the insect stage. The current data set also provides much needed genetic validation to identify new drug targets. RIT-seq represents a versatile new tool for genome-scale functional analyses and for the exploitation of genome sequence data."
1011,Methylglyoxal metabolism in trypanosomes and leishmania.,10.1016/j.semcdb.2011.02.001,2011-02-12,[],"Methylglyoxal is a toxic by-product of glycolysis and other metabolic pathways. In mammalian cells, the principal route for detoxification of this reactive metabolite is via the glutathione-dependent glyoxalase pathway forming d-lactate, involving lactoylglutathione lyase (GLO1; EC 4.4.1.5) and hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase (GLO2; EC 3.2.1.6). In contrast, the equivalent enzymes in the trypanosomatid parasites Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. show >200-fold selectivity for glutathionylspermidine and trypanothione over glutathione and are therefore sensu stricto lactoylglutathionylspermidine lyases (EC 4.4.1.-) and hydroxyacylglutathionylspermidine hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-). The unique substrate specificity of the parasite glyoxalase enzymes can be directly attributed to their unusual active site architecture. The African trypanosome differs from these parasites in that it lacks GLO1 and converts methylglyoxal to l-lactate rather than d-lactate. Since Trypanosoma brucei is the most sensitive of the trypanosomatids to methylglyoxal toxicity, the absence of a complete and functional glyoxalase pathway in these parasites is perplexing. Alternative routes of methylglyoxal detoxification in T. brucei are discussed along with the potential of exploiting trypanosomatid glyoxalase enzymes as targets for anti-parasitic chemotherapy."
1012,Futile import of tRNAs and proteins into the mitochondrion of Trypanosoma brucei evansi.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2010.12.010,2011-01-05,[],"Trypanosoma brucei brucei has two distinct developmental stages, the procyclic stage in the insect and the bloodstream stage in the mammalian host. The significance of each developmental stage is punctuated by specific changes in metabolism. In the insect, T. b. brucei is strictly dependent on mitochondrial function and thus respiration to generate the bulk of its ATP, whereas in the mammalian host it relies heavily on glycolysis. These observations have raised questions about the importance of mitochondrial function in the bloodstream stage. Peculiarly, akinetoplastic strains of Trypanosoma brucei evansi that lack mitochondrial DNA do exist in the wild and are developmentally locked in the glycolysis-dependent bloodstream stage. Using RNAi we show that two mitochondrion-imported proteins, mitochondrial RNA polymerase and guide RNA associated protein 1, are still imported into the nucleic acids-lacking organelle of T. b. evansi, making the need for these proteins futile. We also show that, like in the T. b. brucei procyclic stage, the mitochondria of both bloodstream stage of T. b. brucei and T. b. evansi import various tRNAs, including those that undergo thiolation. However, we were unable to detect mitochondrial thiolation in the akinetoplastic organelle. Taken together, these data suggest a lack of connection between nuclear and mitochondrial communication in strains of T. b. evansi that lost mitochondrial genome and that do not required an insect vector for survival."

This holds not only for multifactorial diseases, such as metabolic syndrome or Type 2 diabetes, but even when a single gene defect is the primary cause, where the adaptive response of the entire network determines the severity of disease. The latter may differ between individuals carrying the same mutation. Understanding the adaptive responses of human metabolism naturally requires a systems biology approach. Modelling of metabolic pathways in micro-organisms and some mammalian tissues has yielded many insights, qualitative as well as quantitative, into their control and regulation. Yet, even for a well-known pathway such as glycolysis, precise predictions of metabolite dynamics from experimentally determined enzyme kinetics have been only moderately successful. In the present review, we compare kinetic models of glycolysis in three cell types (African trypanosomes, yeast and skeletal muscle), evaluate their predictive power and identify limitations in our understanding. Although each of these models has its own merits and shortcomings, they also share common features. For example, in each case independently measured enzyme kinetic parameters were used as input. Based on these 'lessons from glycolysis', we will discuss how to make best use of kinetic computer models to advance our understanding of human metabolic diseases."
1019,Proteomics of Trypanosoma evansi infection in rodents.,10.1371/journal.pone.0009796,2010-03-27,[],"Trypanosoma evansi infections, commonly called 'surra', cause significant economic losses to livestock industry. While this infection is mainly restricted to large animals such as camels, donkeys and equines, recent reports indicate their ability to infect humans. There are no World Animal Health Organization (WAHO) prescribed diagnostic tests or vaccines available against this disease and the available drugs show significant toxicity. There is an urgent need to develop improved methods of diagnosis and control measures for this disease. Unlike its related human parasites T. brucei and T. cruzi whose genomes have been fully sequenced T. evansi genome sequence remains unavailable and very little efforts are being made to develop improved methods of prevention, diagnosis and treatment. With a view to identify potential diagnostic markers and drug targets we have studied the clinical proteome of T. evansi infection using mass spectrometry (MS).
Using shot-gun proteomic approach involving nano-lc Quadrupole Time Of Flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry we have identified over 160 proteins expressed by T. evansi in mice infected with camel isolate. Homology driven searches for protein identification from MS/MS data led to most of the matches arising from related Trypanosoma species. Proteins identified belonged to various functional categories including metabolic enzymes; DNA metabolism; transcription; translation as well as cell-cell communication and signal transduction. TCA cycle enzymes were strikingly missing, possibly suggesting their low abundances. The clinical proteome revealed the presence of known and potential drug targets such as oligopeptidases, kinases, cysteine proteases and more.
Previous proteomic studies on Trypanosomal infections, including human parasites T. brucei and T. cruzi, have been carried out from lab grown cultures. For T. evansi infection this is indeed the first ever proteomic study reported thus far. In addition to providing a glimpse into the biology of this neglected disease, our study is the first step towards identification of diagnostic biomarkers, novel drug targets as well as potential vaccine candidates to fight against T. evansi infections."

One of them, the efficacy of a candidate, can be estimated in silico if an appropriate ordinary differential equation model of the affected pathway is available. With such a model at hand it is also possible to detect reactions having a large effect on a certain variable such as a substance concentration.
We show an algorithm that systematically tests the influence of activators and inhibitors of different type and strength acting at different positions in the network. The effect on a quantity to be selected (e.g. a steady state flux or concentration) is calculated. Moreover, combinations of two inhibitors or one inhibitor and one activator targeting different network positions are analysed. Furthermore, we present TIde (Target Identification), an open source, platform independent tool to investigate ordinary differential equation models in the common systems biology markup language format. It automatically assigns the respectively altered kinetics to the inhibited or activated reactions, performs the necessary calculations, and provides a graphical output of the analysis results. For illustration, TIde is used to detect optimal inhibitor positions in simple branched networks, a signalling pathway, and a well studied model of glycolysis in Trypanosoma brucei.
Using TIde, we show in the branched models under which conditions inhibitions in a certain pathway can affect a molecule concentrations in a different. In the signalling pathway we illuminate which inhibitions have an effect on the signalling characteristics of the last active kinase. Finally, we compare our set of best targets in the glycolysis model with a similar analysis showing the applicability of our tool."

For example, procyclic form (PF) trypanosomes monitor changes in glucose levels to regulate surface molecule expression, which is important for survival in the tsetse fly vector. The molecular connection between glycolysis and surface molecule expression is unknown. Here we partially characterize T. brucei homologs of the beta and gamma subunits of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and determine their roles in regulating surface molecule expression. Using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry, we found that TbAMPKbeta or TbAMPKgamma-deficient parasites express both of the major surface molecules, EP- and GPEET-procyclin, with the latter being a form that is expressed when glucose is low such as in the tsetse fly. Last, we have found that the putative scaffold component of the complex, TbAMPKbeta, fractionates with organellar components and colocalizes in part with a glycosomal marker as well as the flagellum of PF parasites."

Culture-derived parasites of each of the three main insect stages of the T. congolense life cycle, i.e., the procyclic, epimastigote and metacyclic stages, and bloodstream stage parasites isolated from infected mice, were used to construct stage-specific cDNA libraries and expressed sequence tags (ESTs or cDNA clones) in each library were sequenced. Thirteen EST clusters encoding different variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) were detected in the metacyclic library and 26 VSG EST clusters were found in the bloodstream library, 6 of which are shared by the metacyclic library. Rare VSG ESTs are present in the epimastigote library, and none were detected in the procyclic library. ESTs encoding enzymes that catalyze oxidative phosphorylation and amino acid metabolism are about twice as abundant in the procyclic and epimastigote stages as in the metacyclic and bloodstream stages. In contrast, ESTs encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle and nucleotide metabolism are about the same in all four developmental stages. Cysteine proteases, kinases and phosphatases are the most abundant enzyme groups represented by the ESTs. All four libraries contain T. congolense-specific expressed sequences not present in the Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi genomes. Normalized cDNA libraries were constructed from the metacyclic and bloodstream stages, and found to be further enriched for T. congolense-specific ESTs. Given that cultured T. congolense offers an experimental advantage over other African trypanosome species, these ESTs provide a basis for further investigation of the molecular properties of these four developmental stages, especially the epimastigote and metacyclic stages for which it is difficult to obtain large quantities of organisms. The T. congolense EST databases are available at: http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/T_congolense/EST_index.shtml. The sequence data have been submitted to EMBL under the following accession numbers: FN263376-FN292969."
1028,Glyoxalase II does not support methylglyoxal detoxification but serves as a general trypanothione thioesterase in African trypanosomes.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2008.09.005,2008-10-14,[],"Glyoxalase I and II form a ubiquitous glutathione-dependent pathway for the detoxification of reactive and mutagenic ketoaldehydes. Methylglyoxal produced as spontaneous by-product of glycolysis is probably the main physiological substrate. Consequently, African trypanosomes with their exorbitant glucose turnover were expected to have a most efficient detoxification system. Trypanosoma brucei possesses a trypanothione [bis(glutathionyl)spermidine]-dependent glyoxalase II but lacks a glyoxalase I gene. Methylglyoxal reductase as well as dehydrogenase activities are negligible. However, the concentrations of methylglyoxal and advanced glycation end products in the parasites are similar to those in different mammalian cells and the mechanism of methylglyoxal elimination remains elusive. Glyoxalase II is an abundant protein. Overexpression of the gene as well as RNA interference in bloodstream and procyclic cells did not result in a growth phenotype. Deletion of both alleles in procyclic parasites revealed that the enzyme is not essential at least under culture conditions. Recombinant glyoxalase II hydrolyzed the trypanothione-thioesters of methylglyoxal, glyoxal and 4,5-dioxovalerate, substrates of the classical glyoxalase system, with high efficiency. The absence of a glyoxalase I, however, renders these thioesters unlikely as physiological substrates. Here we show that trypanothione-thioesters can be generated from the respective coenzyme A derivative by transesterification. S-Acetyl- and S-propionyltrypanothione obtained by this spontaneous reaction proved to be excellent substrates of T. brucei glyoxalase II. This offers a function for the parasite glyoxalase II as general trypanothione thioesterase independent of ketoaldehyde detoxification."
1030,Global metabolic responses of mice to Trypanosoma brucei brucei infection.,10.1073/pnas.0801777105,2008-04-17,[],"Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is transmitted by tsetse flies and, if untreated, is fatal. Treatment depends on infection stage, and early diagnosis is crucial for effective disease management. The systemic host biochemical changes induced by HAT that enable biomarker discovery or relate to therapeutic outcome are largely unknown. We have characterized the multivariate temporal responses of mice to Trypanosoma brucei brucei infection, using (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic metabolic phenotyping of urine and plasma. Marked alterations in plasma metabolic profiles were detected already 1 day postinfection. Elevated plasma concentrations of lactate, branched chain amino acids, and acetylglycoprotein fragments were noted. T. brucei brucei-infected mice also had an imbalance of plasma alanine and valine, consistent with differential gluconeogenesis (parasite)-ketogenesis (host) pathway counterflux, involving stimulated host glycolysis, ketogenesis, and enhanced lipid oxidation in the host. Histopathologic evidence of T. brucei brucei-induced extramedullary hepatic hemopoiesis, renal interstitial nephritis, and a provoked inflammatory response was also noted. Metabolic disturbance of gut microbiotal activity was associated with infection, as indicated by changes in the urinary concentrations of the microbial co-metabolites, including hippurate. Concluding, parasite infection results in multiple systemic biochemical effects in the host and disturbance of the symbiotic gut microbial metabolic interactions. Investigation of these transgenomic metabolic alterations may underpin the development of new diagnostic criteria and metrics of therapeutic efficacy."
1033,Turnover of glycosomes during life-cycle differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.4161/auto.5443,2008-03-28,[],"Protozoan Kinetoplastida, a group that comprises the pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei, compartmentalize several metabolic systems such as the major part of the glycolytic pathway, in multiple peroxisome-like organelles, designated glycosomes. Trypanosomes have a complicated life cycle, involving two major, distinct stages living in the mammalian bloodstream and several stages inhabiting different body parts of the tsetse fly. Previous studies on non-differentiating trypanosomes have shown that the metabolism and enzymatic contents of glycosomes in bloodstream-form and cultured procyclic cells, representative of the stage living in the insect's midgut, differ considerably. In this study, the morphology of glycosomes and their position relative to the lysosome were followed, as were the levels of some glycosomal enzymes and markers for other subcellular compartments, during the differentiation from bloodstream-form to procyclic trypanosomes. Our studies revealed a small tendency of glycosomes to associate with the lysosome when a population of long-slender bloodstream forms differentiated into short-stumpy forms which are pre-adapted to live in the fly. The same phenomenon was observed during the short-stumpy to procyclic transformation, but then the process was fast and many more glycosomes were associated with the dramatically enlarged degradation organelle. The observations suggested an efficient glycosome turnover involving autophagy. Changes observed in the levels of marker enzymes are consistent with the notion that, during differentiation, glycosomes with enzymatic contents specific for the old life-cycle stage are degraded and new glycosomes with different contents are synthesized, causing that the metabolic repertoire of trypanosomes is, at each stage, optimally adapted to the environmental conditions encountered."

However, the understanding of these phenomena is far from complete and detailed investigation of their proximate causes is needed. Many studies report behavioural modifications, such as altered feeding rates in tsetse fly (Glossina) infected with the mature transmissible stage (i.e. metacyclic) of the trypanosomes. Here, bidimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were employed to analyse and compare the head proteome between four Glossina palpalis gambiensis categories (uninfected, refractory, mature infection, immature infection). Twenty-four protein spots specifically present or absent in the head of metacyclic-infected flies were observed. These protein spots were subsequently identified and functionally classified as glycolitic, neurotransmiter synthesis, signalling, molecular chaperone and transcriptional regulation proteins. Our results indicate altered energy metabolism in the head of metacyclic-infected tsetse flies. Some of the proteins identified, such as casein kinase 2 and jun kinase have previously been shown to play critical roles in apoptosis in insect neurones. In addition, we found two pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylases (dopa decarboxylase and alpha methyldopa hypersensitive protein), suggesting a modification of serotonin and/or dopamine in the brain of metacyclic-infected tsetse flies. Our data pave the way for future investigation of the alteration of the glossina central nervous system during infection by trypanosomes."
1036,Mitochondrial complexes in Trypanosoma brucei: a novel complex and a unique oxidoreductase complex.,10.1074/mcp.M700430-MCP200,2007-12-13,[],"African trypanosomes, early diverged eukaryotes and the agents of sleeping sickness, have several basic cellular processes that are remarkably divergent from those in their mammalian hosts. They have large mitochondria and switch between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis as the major pathways for energy generation during their life cycle. We report here the identification and characterization of several multiprotein mitochondrial complexes from procyclic form Trypanosoma brucei. These were identified and purified using a panel of monoclonal antibodies that were generated against a submitochondrial protein fraction and using tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag affinity chromatography and localized within the cells by immunofluorescence. Protein composition analyses by mass spectrometry revealed substantial divergence of oxidoreductase complex from that of other organisms and identified a novel complex that may have a function associated with nucleic acids. The relationship to divergent physiological processes in these pathogens is discussed."
1038,Characterization of the role of the receptors PEX5 and PEX7 in the import of proteins into glycosomes of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2007.01.006,2007-02-27,[],"Peroxins 5 and 7 are receptors for protein import into the peroxisomal matrix. We studied the involvement of these peroxins in the biogenesis of glycosomes in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Glycosomes are peroxisome-like organelles in which a major part of the glycolytic pathway is sequestered. We here report the characterization of the T. brucei homologue of PEX7 and provide several data strongly suggesting that it can bind to PEX5. Depletion of PEX5 or PEX7 by RNA interference had a severe effect on the growth of both the bloodstream-form of the parasite, that relies entirely on glycolysis for its ATP supply, and the procyclic form representative of the parasite living in the tsetse-fly midgut and in which also other metabolic pathways play a prominent role. The role of the two receptors in import of glycosomal matrix proteins with different types of peroxisome/glycosome-targeting signals (PTS) was analyzed by immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies. Knocking down the expression of either receptor gene resulted, in procyclic cells, in the mislocalization of proteins with both a type 1 or 2 targeting motif (PTS1, PTS2) located at the C- and N-termini, respectively, and proteins with a sequence-internal signal (I-PTS) to the cytosol. Electron microscopy confirmed the apparent integrity of glycosomes in these procyclic cells. In bloodstream-form trypanosomes, PEX7 depletion seemed to affect only the subcellular distribution of PTS2-proteins. Western blot analysis suggested that, in both life-cycle stages of the trypanosome, the levels of both receptors are controlled in a coordinated fashion, by a mechanism that remains to be determined. The observation that both PEX5 and PEX7 are essential for the viability of the parasite indicates that the respective branches of the glycosome-import pathway in which each receptor acts might be interesting drug targets."
1039,Metabolic control analysis to identify optimal drug targets.,10.1007/978-3-7643-7567-6_7,2007-01-02,[],"This chapter describes the basic principles of Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) which is a quantitative methodology to evaluate the importance and relative contribution of individual metabolic steps in the overall functioning of a particular system. The control on the flux through a metabolic pathway or subsystem can be quantified by the control coefficients of the individual enzymes or components which reflects the extent to which the component is rate-limiting. The perturbation of an individual step is measured by its elasticity coefficient. The effect of perturbation of a single step on the entire pathway or subsystem is, in turn, measured by the response coefficient. Differential control analysis can be used to compare flux through a single metabolic pathway in a pathogen with the same pathway in its host to identify uniquely vulnerable steps with the greatest potential for specifically inhibiting flux through the pathogen metabolic pathway. The utility of this methodology is illustrated with the glycolysis in Trypanosomes and with oncogenic signaling."
1041,Cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase is an essential gene in procyclic form Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1007/s00436-006-0332-7,2006-10-07,[],"Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are, in part, driven by the interconversion of 3- and 2-phosphoglycerate (3-PG and 2-PG) which is performed by phosphoglycerate mutases (PGAMs) which can be cofactor dependant (dPGAM) or cofactor independent (iPGAM). The African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, possesses the iPGAM form which is thought to play an important role in glycolysis. Here, we report on the use of RNA interference to down-regulate the T. brucei iPGAM in procyclic form T. brucei and evaluation of the resulting phenotype. We first demonstrated biochemically that depletion of the steady state levels of iPGM mRNA correlates with a marked reduction of enzyme activity. We further show that iPGAM is required for cell growth in procyclic T. brucei."
1042,Metabolic functions of glycosomes in trypanosomatids.,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2006.08.019,2006-10-07,[],"Protozoan Kinetoplastida, including the pathogenic trypanosomatids of the genera Trypanosoma and Leishmania, compartmentalize several important metabolic systems in their peroxisomes which are designated glycosomes. The enzymatic content of these organelles may vary considerably during the life-cycle of most trypanosomatid parasites which often are transmitted between their mammalian hosts by insects. The glycosomes of the Trypanosoma brucei form living in the mammalian bloodstream display the highest level of specialization; 90% of their protein content is made up of glycolytic enzymes. The compartmentation of glycolysis in these organelles appears essential for the regulation of this process and enables the cells to overcome short periods of anaerobiosis. Glycosomes of all other trypanosomatid forms studied contain an extended glycolytic pathway catalyzing the aerobic fermentation of glucose to succinate. In addition, these organelles contain enzymes for several other processes such as the pentose-phosphate pathway, beta-oxidation of fatty acids, purine salvage, and biosynthetic pathways for pyrimidines, ether-lipids and squalenes. The enzymatic content of glycosomes is rapidly changed during differentiation of mammalian bloodstream-form trypanosomes to the forms living in the insect midgut. Autophagy appears to play an important role in trypanosomatid differentiation, and several lines of evidence indicate that it is then also involved in the degradation of old glycosomes, while a population of new organelles containing different enzymes is synthesized. The compartmentation of environment-sensitive parts of the metabolic network within glycosomes would, through this way of organelle renewal, enable the parasites to adapt rapidly and efficiently to the new conditions."
1043,Trypanosoma brucei glycosomal ABC transporters: identification and membrane targeting.,10.1080/09687860500460124,2006-06-07,[],"Trypanosomes contain unique peroxisome-like organelles designated glycosomes which sequester enzymes involved in a variety of metabolic processes including glycolysis. We identified three ABC transporters associated with the glycosomal membrane of Trypanosoma brucei. They were designated GAT1-3 for Glycosomal ABC Transporters. These polypeptides are so-called half-ABC transporters containing only one transmembrane domain and a single nucleotide-binding domain, like their homologues of mammalian and yeast peroxisomes. The glycosomal localization was shown by immunofluorescence microscopy of trypanosomes expressing fusion constructs of the transporters with Green Fluorescent Protein. By expression of fluorescent deletion constructs, the glycosome-targeting determinant of two transporters was mapped to different fragments of their respective primary structures. Interestingly, these fragments share a short sequence motif and contain adjacent to it one--but not the same--of the predicted six transmembrane segments of the transmembrane domain. We also identified the T. brucei homologue of peroxin PEX19, which is considered to act as a chaperonin and/or receptor for cytosolically synthesized proteins destined for insertion into the peroxisomal membrane. By using a bacterial two-hybrid system, it was shown that glycosomal ABC transporter fragments containing an organelle-targeting determinant can interact with both the trypanosomatid and human PEX19, despite their low overall sequence identity. Mutated forms of human PEX19 that lost interaction with human peroxisomal membrane proteins also did not bind anymore to the T. brucei glycosomal transporter. Moreover, fragments of the glycosomal transporter were targeted to the peroxisomal membrane when expressed in mammalian cells. Together these results indicate evolutionary conservation of the glycosomal/peroxisomal membrane protein import mechanism."
1044,Comparative proteomics of glycosomes from bloodstream form and procyclic culture form Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1002/pmic.200500668,2006-04-20,[],"Peroxisomes are present in nearly every eukaryotic cell and compartmentalize a wide range of important metabolic processes. Glycosomes of Kinetoplastid parasites are peroxisome-like organelles, characterized by the presence of the glycolytic pathway. The two replicating stages of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, the mammalian bloodstream form (BSF) and the insect (procyclic) form (PCF), undergo considerable adaptations in metabolism when switching between the two different hosts. These adaptations involve also substantial changes in the proteome of the glycosome. Comparative (non-quantitative) analysis of BSF and PCF glycosomes by nano LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS resulted in the validation of known functional aspects of glycosomes and the identification of novel glycosomal constituents."

Genes for three proteins involved in glycosome biogenesis of Trypanosoma brucei were identified. A preliminary analysis of these proteins, the peroxins PEX6, PEX10 and PEX12, was performed. Cellular depletion of these peroxins by RNA interference affected growth of both mammalian bloodstream-form and insect-form (procyclic) trypanosomes. The bloodstream forms, which rely entirely on glycolysis for their ATP supply, were more rapidly killed. Both by immunofluorescence studies of intact procyclic T. brucei cells and subcellular fractionation experiments involving differential permeabilization of plasma and organellar membranes it was shown that RNAi-dependent knockdown of the expression of each of these peroxins resulted in the partial mis-localization of different types of glycosomal matrix enzymes to the cytoplasm: proteins with consensus motifs such as the C-terminal type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal PTS1 or the N-terminal signal PTS2 and a protein for which the sorting information is present in a polypeptide-internal fragment not containing an identifiable consensus sequence."
1048,Glycolysis and Flux Control.,10.1128/ecosalplus.3.5.1,2005-11-01,[],"Central metabolism of carbohydrates uses the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP), pentose phosphate (PP), and Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathways. This review reviews the biological roles of the enzymes and genes of these three pathways of E. coli. Glucose, pentoses, and gluconate are primarily discussed as the initial substrates of the three pathways, respectively. The genetic and allosteric regulatory mechanisms of glycolysis and the factors that affect metabolic flux through the pathways are considered here. Despite the fact that a lot of information on each of the reaction steps has been accumulated over the years for E. coli, surprisingly little quantitative information has been integrated to analyze glycolysis as a system. Therefore, the review presents a detailed description of each of the catalytic steps by a systemic approach. It considers both structural and kinetic aspects. Models that include kinetic information of the reaction steps will always contain the reaction stoichiometry and therefore follow the structural constraints, but in addition to these also kinetic rate laws must be fulfilled. The kinetic information obtained on isolated enzymes can be integrated using computer models to simulate behavior of the reaction network formed by these enzymes. Successful examples of such approaches are the modeling of glycolysis in S. cerevisiae, the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, and the red blood cell. With the rapid developments in the field of Systems Biology many new methods have been and will be developed, for experimental and theoretical approaches, and the authors expect that these will be applied to E. coli glycolysis in the near future."
1049,The extraordinary mitochondrion and unusual citric acid cycle in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1042/BST20050967,2005-10-26,[],"African trypanosomes are parasitic protozoa that cause sleeping sickness and nagana. Trypanosomes are not only of scientific interest because of their clinical importance, but also because these protozoa contain several very unusual biological features, such as their specially adapted mitochondrion and the compartmentalization of glycolytic enzymes in glycosomes. The energy metabolism of Trypanosoma brucei differs significantly from that of their hosts and changes drastically during the life cycle. Despite the presence of all citric acid cycle enzymes in procyclic insect-stage T. brucei, citric acid cycle activity is not used for energy generation. Recent investigations on the influence of substrate availability on the type of energy metabolism showed that absence of glycolytic substrates did not induce a shift from a fermentative metabolism to complete oxidation of substrates. Apparently, insect-stage T. brucei use parts of the citric acid cycle for other purposes than for complete degradation of mitochondrial substrates. Parts of the cycle are suggested to be used for (i) transport of acetyl-CoA units from the mitochondrion to the cytosol for the biosynthesis of fatty acids, (ii) degradation of proline and glutamate to succinate, (iii) generation of malate, which can then be used for gluconeogenesis. Therefore the citric acid cycle in trypanosomes does not function as a cycle."

Trypanosomes are not only of scientific interest because of their clinical importance, but also because these protozoa contain several very unusual biological features, such as their special energy metabolism. The energy metabolism of Trypanosoma brucei differs significantly from that of its host, not only because it comprises distinct enzymes and metabolic pathways, but also because some of the glycolytic enzymes are localized in organelles called glycosomes. Furthermore, the energy metabolism changes drastically during the complex life cycle of this parasite. This review will focus on the recent advances made in understanding the process of ATP production in T. brucei during its life cycle and the consequences of the special subcellular compartmentation."
1052,Identification of trypanosomatid PEX19: functional characterization reveals impact on cell growth and glycosome size and number.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2005.03.008,2005-05-24,[],"Glycosomes are peroxisome-like organelles present in trypanosomatid pathogens. These organelles compartmentalize glycolysis, among other reactions, and are essential in both bloodstream and procyclic form Trypanosoma brucei. Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins necessary for biogenesis of peroxisomes and glycosomes. In each assembled trypanosomatid genome, we identified a predicted protein with approximately 20% sequence identity to human PEX19, a protein required for insertion of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) into the membrane. Functional analysis demonstrated that these proteins are indeed PEX19 orthologues. Like other PEX19s, T. brucei and Leishmania major PEX19 GFP fusion proteins are predominantly cytosolic. We further showed that LmPEX19 interacts with the glycosomal membrane protein PEX2 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Partial knockdown of TbPEX19 slowed parasite growth, particularly when glucose was present. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopic studies revealed biogenesis defect as evidenced by a sharp reduction in the number of glycosomes. Surprisingly, a four-fold increase in the size of the remaining glycosomes was observed. We propose that this phenotype of fewer but larger glycosomes results from the reduction in import of glycosomal membrane proteins."

Perhaps the most divergent peroxisomes known are the glycosomes of trypanosomes and their relatives. The glycolytic pathway of these organisms resides within the glycosome. The development of robust molecular genetic and proteomic approaches coupled with the completion of the genome sequence of the pathogens Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania major provides an opportunity to determine the complement of proteins within the glycosome and the function of compartmentation. Studies now suggest that regulation of glycolysis is a strong driving force for maintenance of the glycosome."
1062,Glyoxalase II of African trypanosomes is trypanothione-dependent.,10.1074/jbc.M401240200,2004-02-21,[],"The glyoxalase system is a ubiquitous pathway catalyzing the glutathione-dependent detoxication of ketoaldehydes such as methylglyoxal, which is mainly formed as a by-product of glycolysis. The gene encoding a glyoxalase II has been cloned from Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. The deduced protein sequence contains the highly conserved metal binding motif THXHXDH but lacks three basic residues shown to fix the glutathione-thioester substrate in the crystal structure of human glyoxalase II. Recombinant T. brucei glyoxalase II hydrolyzes lactoylglutathione, but does not show saturation kinetics up to 5 mm with the classical substrate of glyoxalases II. Instead, the parasite enzyme strongly prefers thioesters of trypanothione (bis(glutathionyl)spermidine), which were prepared from methylglyoxal and trypanothione and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Mono-(lactoyl)trypanothione and bis-(lactoyl)trypanothione are hydrolyzed by T. brucei glyoxalase II with k(cat)/K(m) values of 5 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1) and 7 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1), respectively, yielding d-lactate and regenerating trypanothione. Glyoxalase II occurs in the mammalian bloodstream and insect procyclic form of T. brucei and is the first glyoxalase II of the order of Kinetoplastida characterized so far. Our results show that the glyoxalase system is another pathway in which the nearly ubiquitous glutathione is replaced by the unique trypanothione in trypanosomatids."
1065,Metabolic analysis in drug design.,10.1016/s1631-0691(03)00117-3,2003-07-31,[],"Biotechnology is often presented as if progress in the past two decades represented a major success, but the reality is quite different. For example, ten major classes of antibiotics were discovered between 1935 and 1963, but after 1963 there has been just one, the oxazolidones. To illustrate the possibilities of doing better by taking account of the real behaviour of metabolic systems, we can examine how one might modify the activity of an enzyme in the cell (for example by genetic manipulation, or by the action of an inhibitor, etc.) to satisfy a technological aim. For example, if the objective is to eliminate a pest, one might suppose that the effect of an inhibitor could be to depress an essential flux to a level insufficient for life, or to raise the concentration of an intermediate to a toxic level. The former may seem the more obvious, but the latter is easier to achieve in practice, and there are some excellent examples of industrial products that work in that way, such as the herbicide 'Roundup' and antimalarials of the quinine class. A study of glycolysis in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei (which causes African sleeping sickness) indicates that for this approach to work the selected target enzyme must have a substrate with a concentration that is not limited by stoichiometric constraints. That is not necessarily easy to find in a complicated system, and typically needs the metabolic network to be analysed in the computer."
1069,Glucose is toxic to glycosome-deficient trypanosomes.,10.1073/pnas.222454899,2002-10-19,[],"Trypanosomatids, the etiologic agents of sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis, and Chagas' disease, compartmentalize glycolysis within glycosomes, metabolic organelles related to peroxisomes. Here, we identify a trypanosome homologue of PEX14, one of the components of the peroxisomal protein import docking complex. We have used double-stranded RNA interference to target the PEX14 transcript for degradation. Glycosomal matrix protein import was compromised, and both glycolytic bloodstream stage parasites and mitochondrially respiring procyclic stage parasites were killed. Thus, unlike peroxisomes, glycosomes are essential organelles. Surprisingly, procyclic forms, which can grow in the absence of glucose, were killed by PEX14 RNA interference only when simple sugars were present. Thus, interference with glycosome protein import makes glucose toxic to trypanosomes."
1074,The role of stoichiometric analysis in studies of metabolism: an example.,10.1006/jtbi.2002.2547,2002-06-25,[],"Stoichiometric analysis uses matrix algebra to deduce the constraints implicit in metabolic networks. When applied to simple networks, it can often give the impression of being an unnecessarily complicated way of arriving at information that is obvious from inspection, for example, that the sum of the concentrations of the adenine nucleotides is constant. Applied to a more complicated example, that of glycolysis in Trypanosoma brucei, it yields information that is far from obvious and may have importance for developing therapeutic ways of eliminating this parasite. Even in simplified form, the network contains nine reactions or transport steps involving 11 metabolites. This immediately shows that there must be at least two stoichiometric constraints, and indeed two can be recognized by inspection: conservation of adenine nucleotides and conservation of the two forms of NAD. There is, however, a third, which involves eight different phosphorylated intermediates in non-obvious combinations and is very difficult to recognize by inspection. It is also difficult to recognize by inspection that no fourth stoichiometric constraint exists. Gaussian elimination provides a systematic way of analysing a network in such a way that all the stoichiometric relationships that it contains emerge automatically."
1075,"Compartmentation of enzymes in a microbody, the glycosome, is essential in Trypanosoma brucei.",10.1242/jcs.115.13.2651,2002-06-22,[],"All kinetoplastids contain membrane-bound microbodies known as glycosomes, in which several metabolic pathways including part of glycolysis are compartmentalized. Peroxin 2 is essential for the import of many proteins into the microbodies of yeasts and mammals. The PEX2 gene of Trypanosoma brucei was identified and its expression was silenced by means of tetracycline-inducible RNA interference. Bloodstream-form trypanosomes, which rely exclusively on glycolysis for ATP generation, died rapidly upon PEX2 depletion. Insect-form (procyclic) trypanosomes do not rely solely on glycolysis for ATP synthesis. PEX2 depletion in procyclic forms resulted in relocation of most tested matrix proteins to the cytosol, and these mutants also died. Compartmentation of microbody enzymes is therefore essential for survival of bloodstream and procyclic T. brucei. In contrast, yeasts and cultured mammalian cells grow normally in the absence of peroxisomal membranes unless placed on selective media."

Here we describe the polymer-assisted synthesis of novel amido derivatives of the scaffold 2'-amino-2'-deoxy-N(6)-(1-naphtylmethyl)adenosine (5a) we reported recently. This building block synthesized in solution was treated with an excess of polymer-supported carboxylic acids leading to chemoselective, practically quantitative conversion of the amine to the desired analogous amides. The best compound (1h) from this series was obtained after on-bead nucleophilic substitution of the carboxylic acid equivalent attached to the Kenner safety catch linker and exhibited an improved inhibitory effect on T. b. brucei blood stream forms with an IC(50) of 0.85 microM in vitro"

Trypanosomatid glycolysis is unique in that it is compartmentalized, and many of its enzymes display unique structural and kinetic features. Structure- and catalytic mechanism-based approaches are applied to design compounds that inhibit the glycolytic enzymes of the parasites without affecting the corresponding proteins of the human host. For some trypanosomatid enzymes, potent and selective inhibitors have already been developed that affect only the growth of cultured trypanosomatids, and not mammalian cells."
1086,"Trypanosoma brucei contains a 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate independent phosphoglycerate mutase.",10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01145.x,2000-02-26,[],"Assays of phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) activity in lysates of bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei appeared not to require exogenous 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, thus suggesting that this protist contains an enzyme belonging to the class of cofactor-independent PGAMs. A gene encoding a polypeptide with motifs characteristic for this class of enzymes was cloned. The predicted T. brucei PGAM polypeptide contains 549 amino acids, with Mr 60 557 and pI 5.5. Comparison with 15 cofactor-independent PGAM sequences available in databases showed that the amino-acid sequence of the trypanosome enzyme has 59-62% identity with plant PGAMs and 29-35% with eubacterial enzymes. A low 28% identity was observed with the only available invertebrate sequence. The trypanosome enzyme has been expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity and subjected to preliminary kinetic analysis. Previous studies have shown that cofactor-dependent and -independent PGAMs are not homologous. It has been inferred that the cofactor-independent PGAMs are in fact homologous to a family of metalloenzymes containing alkaline phosphatases and sulphatases. Prediction of the secondary structure of T. brucei PGAM and threading the sequence into the known crystal structure of E. coli alkaline phosphatase (AP) confirmed this homology, despite the very low sequence identity. Generally, a good match between predicted (PGAM) and actual (AP) secondary structure elements was observed. In contrast to trypanosomes, glycolysis in all vertebrates involves a cofactor-dependent PGAM. The presence of distinct nonhomologous PGAMs in the parasite and its human host offers great potential for the design of selective inhibitors which could form leads for new trypanocidal drugs."
1091,A protein linked to mitochondrion development in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/s0166-6851(99)00065-1,1999-07-21,[],"The use of the two-hybrid system in yeast allowed us to isolate a new mitochondrial protein of Trypanosoma brucei, termed PIE8, for putative protein interacting with ESAG8. This protein was found to localize progressively in the single mitochondrion of the parasite during the mitochondrial reactivation needed to adapt the parasite from the glycolysis-based metabolism in the mammalian host, to the cytochrome-mediated respiration in the fly vector. Once this reactivation is established, PIE8 is lost from the mitochondrion. Thus, the temporary presence of PIE8 in the mitochondrion is linked to mitochondrial reactivation."
1093,Influence of growth conditions on RNA levels in relation to activity of core metabolic enzymes in the parasitic protists Trypanosoma brucei and Trichomonas vaginalis.,10.1099/13500872-145-3-755,1999-04-27,[],"Levels of mRNAs encoding metabolic enzymes and their cellular activities were measured on continuous culture samples of the parasitic protists Trypanosoma brucei and Trichomonas vaginalis. The organisms were grown in chemostats at varying growth rates under glucose limitation or in the presence of excess glucose (EG), resulting in extensive adaptation of the cellular activities of glycolytic enzymes. rRNA and mRNA for beta-tubulin were monitored as controls. In Trypanosoma brucei levels of all RNAs showed a biphasic dependence on growth rate (= dilution rate D), with a sharp increase at higher D values. Cellular RNA levels of Trichomonas vaginalis rate-limited by glucose decreased slightly with increasing D. In EG-grown cells the opposite trend was observed. Equal levels for both carbon regimes were observed at intermediate D values. In both species the ratio between rRNA and mRNA encoding beta-tubulin was constant, independent of the carbon regime. mRNA encoding metabolic enzymes showed varying degrees of correlation with rRNA and beta-tubulin mRNA. In contrast, there was little to no correlation between mRNA levels and the activities of the enzymes they encode, even though only one of these is allosterically regulated. The data indicate that RNA levels in Trypanosoma brucei and Trichomonas vaginalis are determined by growth rate and in the latter species by the availability of the carbon and energy source. Rates of synthesis of metabolic enzymes are most likely regulated at the post-transcriptional level."
1098,Compartmentation of phosphoglycerate kinase in Trypanosoma brucei plays a critical role in parasite energy metabolism.,10.1073/pnas.95.20.11596,1998-09-30,[],"African trypanosomes compartmentalize glycolysis in a microbody, the glycosome. When growing in the mammalian bloodstream, trypanosomes contain only a rudimentary mitochondrion, and the first seven glycolytic enzymes, including phosphoglycerate kinase, are located in the glycosome. Procyclic trypanosomes, growing in the gut of tsetse flies, possess a fully developed mitochondrion that is active in oxidative phosphorylation. The first six glycolytic enzymes are still glycosomal, but phosphoglycerate kinase is now found in the cytosol. We demonstrate here that bloodstream trypanosomes are killed by expression of cytosolic phosphoglycerate kinase. The toxicity depends on both enzyme activity and cytosolic location. One possible explanation is that cytosolic phosphoglycerate kinase creates an ATP-generating shunt in the cytosol, thus preventing full ATP regeneration in the glycosome and ultimately inhibiting the first, ATP-consuming, steps of glycolysis."
1103,Elongation and clustering of glycosomes in Trypanosoma brucei overexpressing the glycosomal Pex11p.,10.1093/emboj/17.13.3542,1998-07-03,[],"Kinetoplastid protozoa confine large parts of glycolysis within glycosomes, which are microbodies related to peroxisomes. We cloned the gene encoding the second most abundant integral membrane protein of Trypanosoma brucei glycosomes. The 24 kDa protein is very basic and hydrophobic, with two predicted transmembrane domains. It is targeted to peroxisomes when expressed in mammalian cells and yeast. The protein is a functional homologue of Pex11p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae: pex11Delta mutants, which are defective in peroxisome proliferation, can be complemented by the trypanosome gene. Sequence conservation is significant in the N- and C-terminal domains of all putative Pex11p homologues known, from trypanosomes, yeasts and mammals. Several lines of evidence indicate that these domains are oriented towards the cytosol. TbPex11p can form homodimers, like its yeast counterpart. The TbPEX11 gene is essential in trypanosomes. Inducible overexpression of the protein in T.brucei bloodstream forms causes growth arrest, the globular glycosomes being transformed to clusters of long tubules filling significant proportions of the cytoplasm. Reduced expression results in trypanosomes with fewer, but larger, organelles."
1108,The trypanocidal Cape buffalo serum protein is xanthine oxidase.,10.1128/iai.65.9.3806-3814.1997,1997-09-01,[],"Plasma and serum from Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) kill bloodstream stages of all species of African trypanosomes in vitro. The trypanocidal serum component was isolated by sequential chromatography on hydroxylapatite, protein A-G, Mono Q, and Superose 12. The purified trypanocidal protein had a molecular mass of 150 kDa, and activity correlated with the presence of a 146-kDa polypeptide detected upon reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Amino acid sequences of three peptide fragments of the 146-kDa reduced polypeptide, ligand affinity and immunoaffinity chromatography of the native protein, and sensitivity to pharmacological inhibitors, identified the trypanocidal material as xanthine oxidase (EC 1.1.3.22). Trypanocidal activity resulted in the inhibition of trypanosome glycolysis and was due to H2O2 produced during catabolism of extracellular xanthine and hypoxanthine by the purine catabolic enzyme."
1119,Identification of a peptide inhibitor against glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinase of Trypanosoma brucei by a synthetic peptide library approach.,10.1016/0968-0896(95)00020-h,1995-03-01,[],"A synthetic peptide library, composed of 2.5 million L-amino acid pentapeptides anchored on polystyrene beads was prepared with each bead bearing a single pentapeptide sequence. This library was screened for interaction with glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinase (gPGK) of Trypanosoma brucei labelled with fluorescein or with biotin. Affinity beads that bound the enzyme were selected with a pipette or with streptavidin coated magnetic beads. The beads that bound to the enzyme were individually subjected to Edman microsequence analysis to determine the sequence of the corresponding peptide ligands. The corresponding peptide-sequences were synthesised as free peptide acids and evaluated for enzyme activity inhibition. The pentapeptide NWMMF was able to selectively inhibit gPGK with an IC50 of approximately 80 microM."
1122,The evolutionary expansion of the trypanosomatid flagellates.,10.1016/0020-7519(94)90198-8,1994-12-01,[],"The trypanosomatids combine a relatively uniform morphology with ability to parasitise a very diverse range of hosts including animals, plants and other protists. Along with their sister family, the biflagellate bodonids, they are set apart from other eukaryotes by distinctive organisational features, such as the kinetoplast-mitochondrion and RNA editing, isolation of glycolysis enzymes in the glycosome, use of the flagellar pocket for molecular traffic into and out of the cell, a unique method of generating cortical microtubules, and bizarre nuclear organisation. These features testify to the antiquity and isolation of the kinetoplast-bearing flagellates (Kinetoplastida). Molecular sequencing techniques (especially small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequencing) are now radically reshaping previous ideas on the phylogeny of these organisms. The idea that the monogenetic (MG) trypanosomatids gave rise to the digenetic (DG) genera is losing ground to a view that, after the bodonids, the African trypanosomes (DG) represent the most ancient lineage, followed by Trypanosoma cruzi (DG), then Blastocrithidia (MG), Herpetomonas (MG) and Phytomonas (DG), with Leptomonas (MG), Crithidia (MG), Leishmania (DG) and Endotrypanum (DG) forming the crown of the evolutionary tree. Vast genetic distances (12% divergence) separate T. brucei and T. cruzi, while the Leishmania species are separated by very short distances (less than 1% divergence). These phylogenetic conclusions are supported by studies on RNA editing and on the nature of the parasite surface. The trypanosomatids seem to be able to adapt with ease their energy metabolism to the availability of substrates and oxygen, and this may give them the ability to institute new life cycles if host behaviour patterns allow. Sexual processes, though present in at least some trypanosomatids, may have played only a minor part in generating diversity during trypanosomatid evolution. On the other hand, the development of altruistic behaviour on the part of some life cycle stages may be a hitherto unconsidered way of maximising fitness in this group. It is concluded that, owing to organisational constraints, the trypanosomatids can undergo substantial molecular variation while registering very little in the way of morphological change."
1125,Developmental regulation of Trypanosoma brucei cytochrome c reductase during bloodstream to procyclic differentiation.,10.1016/0166-6851(94)90080-9,1994-06-01,[],"The bloodstream forms of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei lack spectrally detectable cytochromes and satisfy energy requirements mainly by glycolysis. When infected blood is ingested by the tse-tse fly vector, the bloodstream form cells differentiate to procyclic forms that have fully functional mitochondria. Procyclic cells have cyanide-sensitive, cytochrome-mediated electron transport and the full complement of TCA cycle enzymes. The developmental regulation of the cytochrome c reductase complex was examined at the RNA and protein levels. RNase T1 protection studies and Northern blot analyses demonstrated that bloodstream and procyclic form cells constitutively expressed the genes for two nuclear encoded cytochrome c reductase subunits, cytochrome c1 and subunit 4. Polyadenylated transcripts of both genes were present in bloodstream form cells at up to 20% of the procyclic cell levels. These levels were significantly up-regulated sometime after the onset of differentiation to the procyclic form. Despite the presence of subunit mRNAs in bloodstream form cells, subunit proteins were not detected until the cells had been allowed to differentiate in vitro for 6 h. Procyclic cell levels of subunit proteins and holocytochromes were reached by 48 h. Our results suggest that cytochrome c reductase is developmentally regulated at multiple levels, some involving post-transcriptional mechanisms."
1127,Developmental regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1007/BF00763067,1994-04-01,[],"The metabolism of Trypanosoma brucei undergoes a significant change as the parasite differentiates from the mammalian bloodstream form to the form found in the tse-tse fly vector. Because the mitochondria of bloodstream form cells lack cytochromes and several key citric acid cycle enzymes, the metabolism of these cells is mostly limited to glycolysis. The reducing equivalents generated by this process are passed to oxygen by a plant-like alternative oxidase. As cells differentiate to the insect form, they begin to oxidatively metabolize proline. The mitochondria of insect form cells contain functional, cytochrome-mediated electron transport chains and have complete complements of citric acid cycle enzymes. Although the characterization is far from complete, the nuclear and mitochondrial genes involved in the expression of these mitochondrial functions appear to be developmentally regulated at posttranscriptional and posttranslational levels. This review outlines some of the molecular processes that are associated with the developmental regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and suggests some possible mechanisms of regulation."
1133,Synthesis and activity of inhibitors highly specific for the glycolytic enzymes from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(93)90218-m,1993-06-01,[],"Most glycosomal enzymes of Trypanosoma brucei carry a relatively high number of positive charges. In at least 3 of the enzymes some of the charges unique to these enzymes are concentrated in 2 distinct areas on the enzymes' surface, about 4 nm apart [4] and these positively charged structural elements have been suggested to be the site of interaction with the trypanocidal drug Suramin. We have synthesized a series of symmetrical long chain molecules with negative charges or strong dipoles at each end. Several of these compounds inhibited the glycosomal enzymes more strongly than Suramin. They also exhibited a specificity for the trypanosome enzymes, when compared with homologous enzymes from other organisms. By varying the chain length of the active compounds, a 4-nm distance between the molecules' extremes proved optimal for inhibition. Tetra-substituted compounds were better than di-substituted. Modifications introduced at the two ends indicated that a planar orientation, with an amide bond linking a phenyl ring to the chain, is preferred. Inhibition kinetics for some of the enzymes indicated the existence of multi-site interactions with the inhibitors."
1136,In vivo import of firefly luciferase into the glycosomes of Trypanosoma brucei and mutational analysis of the C-terminal targeting signal.,10.1091/mbc.3.7.749,1992-07-01,[],"The compartmentalization of glycolytic enzymes into specialized organelles, the glycosomes, allows the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei to rely solely on glycolysis for its energy production. The biogenesis of glycosomes in these parasites has been studied intensively as a potential target for chemotherapy. We have adapted the recently developed methods for stable transformation of T. brucei to the in vivo analysis of glycosomal protein import. Firefly luciferase, a peroxisomal protein in the lantern of the insect, was expressed in stable transformants of the procyclic form of T. brucei, where it was found to accumulate inside the glycosomes. Mutational analysis of the peroxisomal targeting signal serine-lysine-leucine (SKL) located at the C-terminus of luciferase showed that replacement of the serine residue (Serine548) with a small neutral amino acid (A, C, G, H, N, P, T) still resulted in an import efficiency of 50-100% of the wild-type luciferase. Lysine549 could be substituted with an amino acid capable of hydrogen bonding (H, M, N, Q, R, S), whereas the C-terminal leucine550 could be replaced with a subset of hydrophobic amino acids (I, M, Y). Thus, a peroxisome-like C-terminal SKL-dependent targeting mechanism may function in T. brucei to import luciferase into the glycosomes. However, a few significant differences exist between the glycosomal targeting signals identified here and the tripeptide sequences that direct proteins to mammalian or yeast peroxisomes."
1137,The cytosolic and glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma brucei. Kinetic properties and comparison with homologous enzymes.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb16032.x,1991-06-01,[],"The protozoan haemoflagellate Trypanosoma brucei has two NAD-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzymes, each with a different localization within the cell. One isoenzyme is found in the cytosol, as in other eukaryotes, while the other is found in the glycosome, a microbody-like organelle that fulfils an essential role in glycolysis. The kinetic properties of the purified glycosomal and cytosolic isoenzymes were compared with homologous enzymes from other organisms. Both trypanosome enzymes had pH/activity profiles similar to that of other glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases, with optimal activity around pH 8.5-9. Only the yeast enzyme showed its maximal activity at a lower pH. The glycosomal enzyme was more sensitive to changes in ionic strength below 0.1 M, while the cytosolic enzyme resembled more the enzymes from rabbit muscle, human erythrocytes and yeast. The affinity for NAD of the glycosomal enzyme was 5-10-fold lower than that of the cytosolic, as well as the other enzymes. A similar, but less pronounced, difference was found for its affinity for NADH. These differences are explained by a number of amino acid substitutions in the NAD-binding domain of the glycosomal isoenzyme. In addition, the effects of suramin, gossypol, agaricic acid and pentalenolactone on the trypanosome enzymes were studied. The trypanocidal drug suramin inhibited both enzymes, but in a different manner. Inhibition of the cytosolic enzyme was competitive with NAD, while in the case of the glycosomal isoenzyme, with NAD as substrate, the drug had an effect both on Km and Vmax. The most potent inhibitor was pentalenolactone, which at micromolar concentrations inhibited the glycosomal enzyme and the enzymes from yeast and Bacillus stearothermophilus in a reversible manner, while the rabbit muscle enzyme was irreversibly inhibited."
1141,Trypanosoma brucei: two-dimensional gel analysis of the major glycosomal proteins during the life cycle.,10.1016/0014-4894(90)90109-p,1990-04-01,[],"Kinetoplastid organisms possess a unique organelle, the glycosome, which compartmentalizes the Embden-Meyerhof segment of glycolysis and several other metabolic pathways. In Trypanosoma brucei many of the enzyme activities localized to the glycosome are stage regulated. Two-dimensional gel analysis was used to examine the characteristics, expression, and biosynthesis of the major glycosomal proteins. Two-dimensional gel maps of glycosomes from slender bloodforms and late intermediate-stumpy bloodforms (the precursors of procyclic forms) were indistinguishable, while those of procyclic form glycosomes showed extensive differences. Glycosomal phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and malate dehydrogenase were identified to have subunit molecular weights of 60 and 34 kDa, respectively. We detected two hitherto undescribed glycosomal proteins, one of which is found only in bloodforms. All of the major proteins, except glucose phosphate isomerase, were highly basic. Stage regulation of glycosomal enzyme activities correlated with stage regulation of specific protein biosynthesis."
1142,Analysis of a genetic cross between Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and T. b. brucei.,10.1017/s0031182000059114,1989-12-01,[],"Two trypanosome clones, representing East and West African homozygotes at 2 isoenzyme loci (T. b. rhodesiense MHOM/ZM/74/58 [CLONE B] and T. b. brucei MSUS/CI/78/TSW 196 [CLONE A]), were cotransmitted through tsetse flies and the resulting trypanosome populations checked for the presence of non-parental karyotypes by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Ten clones isolated from these populations proved to have 5 different recombinant genotypes by analysis of nuclear and kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) polymorphisms. It is inferred that genetic exchange occurred between the 2 trypanosome clones in the fly, as previously reported for 2 other T. brucei spp. clones by Jenni and colleagues. For the most part, the hybrid clones shared many characteristics with both parents and their genotypes were consistent with segregation and reassortment of parental alleles. The least amount of genetic material exchanged was kDNA alone. Regarding the mechanism of genetic exchange, several hybrid clones had identical and unique nuclear DNA polymorphisms, but different kDNA type. Assuming that the same reassortment of nuclear markers is unlikely to occur by chance, these clones most probably arose from a predecessor carrying both types of kDNA."
1149,Two distinct succinate thiokinases in both bloodstream and procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0006-291x(88)90587-6,1988-02-29,[],"Two succinate thiokinase activities specific for either adenine or guanine nucleotides have been found in Trypanosoma brucei. Key glycolytic and citric acid cycle enzymes were measured to show repression of glycolysis and derepression of the citric acid cycle in the procyclic form, relative to the bloodstream form. A marked rise in adenine-linked succinate thiokinase activity accompanied a rise in activity of citric acid cycle enzymes. However, guanine-linked succinate thiokinase was found to increase only slightly in activity. These results implicate the adenine-linked enzyme as an essential component of the citric acid cycle, whereas the guanine-linked enzyme appears to be under separate control. This communication also reports for the first time the occurrence of citrate synthase activity in the bloodstream (long slender) form of T. brucei."
1153,Identification of two integral glycosomal membrane proteins in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(87)90021-1,1987-08-01,[],"Glycosomal membranes of bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei were purified to apparent homogeneity by sodium carbonate treatment and found to contain two major integral membrane proteins of 26 kDa (band 10) and 24 kDa (band 11). The procyclic-form glycosomal membranes isolated by the same procedure also resulted in a homogeneous preparation, but each piece of membrane thus purified was associated with an electron-dense granule. Procyclic membranes also contained primarily bands 10 and 11. These two proteins were selectively reduced by protease treatment of intact glycosomes, suggesting surface exposed domain(s) of the two proteins accessible to proteolytic digestion. They and band 8 protein also vanished in glycosomal lysates by apparent proteolysis, implying the presence of a specific protease which degrades the integral membrane proteins upon the loss of membrane integrity. The two proteins, hydrophobic in nature and apparently unglycosylated, have no known biological functions, but their possible involvement in translocating precursor proteins from the cytoplasm into the glycosome of T. brucei is postulated."

However, the strong stimulation of the glycolytic rate by exogenous metabolites and coenzymes in intact glycosomes is only compatible with their accessibility to the internal space. The accessibility of glycosomal enzymes to protein labeling agents of varying charge and size has been investigated. The results show that the glycosomal membrane is permeable to small molecules of the size of metabolites, but impermeable to larger molecules."

Differential centrifugation followed by two isopycnic centrifugations in an isotonic Percoll and in a sucrose gradient, respectively, resulted in 12- to 13-fold purified glycosomes with an overall yield of 31%. These glycosomes appeared to be highly pure and contained less than 1% mitochondrial contamination as judged by morphometric and biochemical analyses. In intact cells, glycosomes displayed a remarkably homogeneous size distribution centered on an average diameter of 0.27 micron with a standard deviation of 0.03 micron. The size distribution of isolated glycosomes differed only slightly from that measured in intact cells. One T. brucei cell contained on average 230 glycosomes, representing 4.3% of the total cell volume. The glycosomes were surrounded by a single membrane and contained as phospholipids only phosphatidyl choline and phosphatidyl ethanolamine in a ratio of 2:1. The purified glycosomal fraction had a very low DNA content of 0.18 microgram/mg protein. No DNA molecules were observed that could not have been derived from contaminating mitochondrial or nuclear debris."
1172,Occurrence and role of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei brucei glycosomes.,10.1016/0166-6851(83)90036-1,1983-05-01,[],"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32) was detected in a particulate fraction of Trypanosoma brucei brucei procyclic culture form. It requires ADP rather than GDP for activity in the direction of carboxylation and is located in the glycosomes. Since phosphoenolpyruvate can serve to furnish ATP for glycolysis and can promote 3-phosphoglycerate or 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate formation without simultaneous alpha-glycerophosphate production, we suggest that the glycosomal phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-malate dehydrogenase tandem contributes to ATP regeneration and NADH re-oxidation in the glycosome, and regulates alpha-glycerophosphate production."

The glycolytic enzymes of Tritrichomonas foetus, unlike those of Trypanosoma brucei, are apparently not located in microbody-like organelles (glycosomes) but appear to occur in the cytosol. 2. The localization of the glycolytic enzymes in Crithidia fasciculata and in the epimastigote and trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi is however similar to that in T. brucei. 3. No evidence was obtained for the existence of glycolytic enzyme-containing microbodies in rat liver. 4. The glycosome is probably an organelle unique to members of the Kinetoplastida."
1192,Trypanocidal activity of antitumor antibiotics and other metabolic inhibitors.,10.1128/AAC.13.5.735,1978-05-01,[],"A microtest has been devised for the rapid preliminary assay in vitro of the effect of over 100 drugs and inhibitors on African trypanosomes (Trypanosoma brucei and T. rhodesiense). Parasite motility and infectivity for mice are indexes, respectively, of respiration and glycolysis and of cell division; trypanocidal titers based on these indexes can show primary metabolic areas of drug attack. Various specific inhibitors have also been tested to detect metabolic sites which might be therapeutically vulnerable. RNA synthesis inhibitors are highly active (adenine nucleosides, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, chromomycin, actinomycin D, mitomycin C); the activity of the nucleoside cordycepin was increased in vitro and in vivo by an adenosine deaminase inhibitor. In view of the polyanionic nature of the trypanocide suramin, a series of polyanions was tested; several showed activity but only poly-d-glutamic acid was active in vivo. Among various miscellaneous inhibitors, quercetin, disulfiram, and the Ca-complexing agents arsenazo I and III showed marked activity, the latter exclusively on the arsenical-resistant T. brucei. The implications of these results for combination chemotherapy and depot prophylaxis (with polyanions) are indicated."

10.1074/jbc.RA119.009087",2022-02-02,[],"Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, is a Neglected Tropical Disease endemic to 36 African countries, with approximately 70 million people currently at risk for infection. Current therapeutics are suboptimal due to toxicity, adverse side effects, and emerging resistance. Thus, both effective and affordable treatments are urgently needed. The causative agent of HAT is the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei ssp. Annotation of its genome confirms previous observations that T. brucei is a purine auxotroph. Incapable of de novo purine synthesis, these protozoan parasites rely on purine phosphoribosyltransferases to salvage purines from their hosts for the synthesis of purine monophosphates. Complete and accurate genome annotations in combination with the identification and characterization of the catalytic activity of purine salvage enzymes enables the development of target-specific therapies in addition to providing a deeper understanding of purine metabolism in T. brucei. In trypanosomes, purine phosphoribosyltransferases represent promising drug targets due to their essential and central role in purine salvage. Enzymes involved in adenine and adenosine salvage, such as adenine phosphoribosyltransferases (APRTs, EC 2.4.2.7), are of particular interest for their potential role in the activation of adenine and adenosine-based pro-drugs. Analysis of the T. brucei genome shows two putative aprt genes: APRT1 (Tb927.7.1780) and APRT2 (Tb927.7.1790). Here we report studies of the catalytic activity of each putative APRT, revealing that of the two T. brucei putative APRTs, only APRT1 is kinetically active, thereby signifying a genomic misannotation of Tb927.7.1790 (putative APRT2). Reliable genome annotation is necessary to establish potential drug targets and identify enzymes involved in adenine and adenosine-based pro-drug activation."

T. vaginalis lacks the biosynthetic pathways for purines and pyrimidines, making nucleoside metabolism a drug target. Here we report the first comprehensive investigation into purine and pyrimidine uptake by T. vaginalis. Multiple carriers were identified and characterized with regard to substrate selectivity and affinity. For nucleobases, a high-affinity adenine transporter, a possible guanine transporter and a low affinity uracil transporter were found. Nucleoside transporters included two high affinity adenosine/guanosine/uridine/cytidine transporters distinguished by different affinities to inosine, a lower affinity adenosine transporter, and a thymidine transporter. Nine Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter (ENT) genes were identified in the T. vaginalis genome. All were expressed equally in metronidazole-resistant and -sensitive strains. Only TvagENT2 was significantly upregulated in the presence of extracellular purines; expression was not affected by co-culture with human cervical epithelial cells. All TvagENTs were cloned and separately expressed in Trypanosoma brucei. We identified the main broad specificity nucleoside carrier, with high affinity for uridine and cytidine as well as purine nucleosides including inosine, as TvagENT3. The in-depth characterization of purine and pyrimidine transporters provides a critical foundation for the development of new anti-trichomonal nucleoside analogues."

Here, we show that in an NTR1-dependent process, benznidazole promotes DNA damage in the nuclear genome of Trypanosoma brucei, providing the first direct link between activation of this prodrug and a downstream trypanocidal mechanism. Phenotypic and protein expression studies revealed that components of the trypanosome's homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway (TbMRE11, γH2A, TbRAD51) cooperate to resolve the benznidazole-induced damage, indicating that the prodrug-induced lesions are most likely double stand DNA breaks, while the sequence/recruitment kinetics of these factors parallels that in other eukaryotes HR systems. When extended to other NTR1-activated 2-nitroimidazoles, some were shown to promote DNA damage. Intriguingly, the lesions induced by these required TbMRE11 and TbCSB activities to fix leading us to postulate that TbCSB may operate in systems other than the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair pathway. Understanding how existing trypanosomal drugs work will aid future drug design and help unlock novel reactions/pathways that could be exploited as targets for therapeutic intervention."

For regulation, mRNA export is tightly connected to the full machinery of nuclear mRNA processing, starting at transcription. Export competence of pre-mRNAs gradually increases by both transient and permanent interactions with multiple RNA processing and export factors. mRNA export is best understood in opisthokonts, with limited knowledge in plants and protozoa. Here, I review and compare nuclear mRNA processing and export between opisthokonts and Trypanosoma brucei. The parasite has many unusual features in nuclear mRNA processing, such as polycistronic transcription and trans-splicing. It lacks several nuclear complexes and nuclear-pore-associated proteins that in opisthokonts play major roles in mRNA export. As a consequence, trypanosome mRNA export control is not tight and export can even start co-transcriptionally. Whether trypanosomes regulate mRNA export at all, or whether leakage of immature mRNA to the cytoplasm is kept to a low level by a fast kinetics of mRNA processing remains to be investigated. mRNA export had to be present in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes. Trypanosomes are evolutionary very distant from opisthokonts and a comparison helps understanding the evolution of mRNA export."

Dependent on the manifestation, drugs either require difficult and lengthy administration, are toxic, expensive, not very effective or have lost efficacy due to the resistance developed by these pathogens against clinical treatments. The intermediary metabolism of Leishmania parasites is characterized by several unusual features, among which whether the Krebs cycle operates in a cyclic and/or in a non-cyclic mode is included. Our survey of the genomes of Leishmania species and monoxenous parasites such as those of the genera Crithidia and Leptomonas (http://www.tritrypdb.org) revealed that two genes encoding putative isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) -with distantly related sequences- are strictly conserved among these parasites. Thus, in this study, we aimed to functionally characterize the two leishmanial IDH isoenzymes, for which we selected the genes LmxM10.0290 (Lmex_IDH-90) and LmxM32.2550 (Lmex_IDH-50) from L. mexicana. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Lmex_IDH-50 clustered with members of Subfamily I, which contains mainly archaeal and bacterial IDHs, and that Lmex_IDH-90 was a close relative of eukaryotic enzymes comprised within Subfamily II IDHs. 3-D homology modeling predicted that both IDHs exhibited the typical folding motifs recognized as canonical for prokaryotic and eukaryotic counterparts, respectively. Both IDH isoforms displayed dual subcellular localization, in the cytosol and the mitochondrion. Kinetic studies showed that Lmex_IDH-50 exclusively catalyzed the reduction of NAD"

Nonetheless, the GMPR of Trypanosoma brucei (TbGMPR) includes a unique structure known as the cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domain, though the role of this domain is not fully understood. Here, we show that guanine and adenine nucleotides exert positive and negative effects, respectively, on TbGMPR activity by binding allosterically to the CBS domain. The present structural analyses revealed that TbGMPR forms an octamer that shows a transition between relaxed and twisted conformations in the absence and presence of guanine nucleotides, respectively, whereas the TbGMPR octamer dissociates into two tetramers when ATP is available instead of guanine nucleotides. These findings demonstrate that the CBS domain plays a key role in the allosteric regulation of TbGMPR by facilitating the transition of its oligomeric state depending on ligand nucleotide availability."

The dinaphthylcyclooctynes proved to be poorly reactive with azides, and the formation of triazole required many days compared to a few hours for the other cyclooctynes. Fluoride atoms and methoxy groups were also introduced to the aryl rings, leading to more active compounds. Oxidation of the alcohol on the cyclooctyne ring also increased the reaction rates by 3.5- to 6-fold. 3,9-Difluoro-4,8-dimethoxy-dibenzocyclooctyne-1-one thus displayed a SPAAC kinetic rate of 3.5 M"
1228,Optimal kinetic exposures for classic and candidate antitrypanosomals.,10.1093/jac/dkz160,2019-05-17,[],"Efficacy is determined not only by size, but also by shape, of drug exposure. Here the critical importance of the temporal pattern of drug concentrations (pharmacokinetic profile) is examined for antitrypanosomals in vitro.
An in vitro hollow-fibre cartridge system was used to study contrasting drug profiles with four clinically used agents and two experimental candidates against the deadly parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Artificial kinetics were employed intentionally to favour either high peak concentration or sustained duration of drug.
Changing the shape of drug exposure significantly impacted drug efficacy. Suramin, melarsoprol and pentamidine were concentration-driven and therefore more efficacious when applied as short-lived high peaks. In contrast, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) was time-driven, and therefore maximally effective as a constant infusion. Kinetic preference was robust over a wide range of drug exposures. Promising clinical candidates SCYX-7158 (acoziborole) and fexinidazole (parent and sulfone) were concentration-driven, suggesting optimal clinical regimens would involve relatively high but intermittent dosing.
Antitrypanosomals have an intrinsic pharmacokinetic driver for optimal efficacy, with important implications for clinical management and future candidate development."

The disease persists due to limited drug availability, toxicity and drug resistance, hence the need for a better understanding of the parasite's biology and provision of alternative forms of therapy. In this study, the in vitro effects of phenolic acids were assessed for their trypanocidal activities against Trypanosoma brucei brucei. The effect of the phenolic acids on Trypanosoma brucei brucei was determined by the alamarBlue assay. The cell cycle effects were determined by flow cytometry and parasite morphological analysis was done by microscopy. Effect on cell proliferation was determined by growth kinetic analysis. Reverse Transcriptase quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction was used to determine expression of iron dependent enzymes and iron distribution determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Gallic acid gave an IC50 of 14.2±1.5 μM. Deferoxamine, gallic acid and diminazene aceturate showed a dose dependent effect on the cell viability and the mitochondrion membrane integrity. Gallic acid, deferoxamine and diminazene aceturate caused loss of kinetoplast in 22%, 26% and 82% of trypanosomes respectively and less than 10% increase in the number of trypanosomes in S phase was observed. Gallic acid caused a 0.6 fold decrease, 50 fold increase and 7 fold increase in the expression levels of the transferrin receptor, ribonucleotide reductase and cyclin 2 genes respectively while treatment with deferoxamine and diminazene aceturate also showed differential expressions of the transferrin receptor, ribonucleotide reductase and cyclin 2 genes. The data suggests that gallic acid possibly exerts its effect on T. brucei via iron chelation leading to structural and morphological changes and arrest of the cell cycle. These together provide information on the cell biology of the parasite under iron starved conditions and provide leads into alternative therapeutic approaches in the treatment of African trypanosomiasis."

Examples of such diseases include trypanosomiasis, which causes sleeping sickness; leishmaniasis; and Chagas disease, all of which are prevalent in Africa, South America, and India. Our aim within the New Medicines for Trypanosomatidic Infections project was to use (1) synthetic and natural product libraries, (2) screening, and (3) a preclinical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion-toxicity (ADME-Tox) profiling platform to identify compounds that can enter the trypanosomatidic drug discovery value chain. The synthetic compound libraries originated from multiple scaffolds with known antiparasitic activity and natural products from the Hypha Discovery MycoDiverse natural products library. Our focus was first to employ target-based screening to identify inhibitors of the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei pteridine reductase 1 ( TbPTR1) and second to use a Trypanosoma brucei phenotypic assay that made use of the T. brucei brucei parasite to identify compounds that inhibited cell growth and caused death. Some of the compounds underwent structure-activity relationship expansion and, when appropriate, were evaluated in a preclinical ADME-Tox assay panel. This preclinical platform has led to the identification of lead-like compounds as well as validated hits in the trypanosomatidic drug discovery value chain."
1231,Isolation of F1-ATPase from the Parasitic Protist Trypanosoma brucei.,10.3791/58334,2019-02-09,[],"F1-ATPase is a membrane-extrinsic catalytic subcomplex of F-type ATP synthase, an enzyme that uses the proton motive force across biological membranes to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The isolation of the intact F1-ATPase from its native source is an essential prerequisite to characterize the enzyme's protein composition, kinetic parameters, and sensitivity to inhibitors. A highly pure and homogeneous F1-ATPase can be used for structural studies, which provide insight into molecular mechanisms of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. This article describes a procedure for the purification of the F1-ATPase from Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiases. The F1-ATPase is isolated from mitochondrial vesicles, which are obtained by hypotonic lysis from in vitro cultured trypanosomes. The vesicles are mechanically fragmented by sonication and the F1-ATPase is released from the inner mitochondrial membrane by the chloroform extraction. The enzymatic complex is further purified by consecutive anion exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. Sensitive mass spectrometry techniques showed that the purified complex is devoid of virtually any protein contaminants and, therefore, represents suitable material for structure determination by X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy. The isolated F1-ATPase exhibits ATP hydrolytic activity, which can be inhibited fully by sodium azide, a potent inhibitor of F-type ATP synthases. The purified complex remains stable and active for at least three days at room temperature. Precipitation by ammonium sulfate is used for long-term storage. Similar procedures have been used for the purification of F1-ATPases from mammalian and plant tissues, yeasts, or bacteria. Thus, the presented protocol can serve as a guideline for the F1-ATPase isolation from other organisms."

Most of these repair reactions have been described in the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei, which is a genetically tractable eukaryotic microbe and important human and animal parasite, but little work has considered how the DNA damage response operates throughout the T. brucei life cycle. Using quantitative PCR we have assessed damage induction and repair in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of the parasite. We show differing kinetics of repair for three forms of DNA damage, and dramatic differences in repair between replicative life cycle forms found in the testse fly midgut and the mammal. We find that mammal-infective T. brucei cells repair oxidative and crosslink-induced DNA damage more efficiently than tsetse-infective cells and, moreover, very distinct patterns of induction and repair of DNA alkylating damage in the two life cycle forms. We also reveal robust repair of DNA lesions in the highly unusual T. brucei mitochondrial genome (the kinetoplast). By examining mutants we show that nuclear alkylation damage is repaired by the concerted action of two repair pathways, and that Rad51 acts in kinetoplast repair. Finally, we correlate repair with cell cycle arrest and cell growth, revealing that induced DNA damage has strikingly differing effects on the two life cycle stages, with distinct timing of alkylation-induced cell cycle arrest and higher levels of damage induced death in mammal-infective cells. Our data reveal that T. brucei regulates the DNA damage response during its life cycle, a capacity that may be shared by many microbial pathogens that exist in variant environments during growth and transmission."

In this study, three newly developed β2 subunit-specific inhibitor (LU-102, LU-002c and LU-002i) were tested for their ability to block the trypsin-like activity of the trypanosomal proteasome. At 10 μM, none of the compounds affected the proteasomal trypsin-like activity in cell lysates of bloodstream forms of T. brucei. On the other hand, leupeptin, a well-established β2 inhibitor, supressed the proteasomal trypsin-like activity within trypanosome cell lysates with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 2 μM demonstrating the inhibitability of the trypsin-like activity of the T. brucei proteasome under the experimental condition. Nevertheless, two compounds (LU-102 and LU-002i) displayed moderate trypanocidal activity with 50% growth inhibition values of 6.9 and 8.5 μM, respectively. In the case of LU-102, it was shown that the trypanocidal activity of the compound was due to inhibition of the major lysosomal cysteine protease TbCATL. The main finding of this study indicate substantial inhibitor sensitivity differences between the trypsin-like sites of the human and trypanosomal proteasomes. Whether these differences can be exploited for the design of anti-trypanosomal drug therapies remains to be shown."
1235,Defining informative priors for ensemble modeling in systems biology.,10.1038/s41596-018-0056-z,2018-10-26,[],"Ensemble modeling in molecular systems biology requires the reproducible translation of kinetic parameter data into informative probability distributions (priors), as well as approaches that sample parameters from these distributions without violating the thermodynamic consistency of the overall model. Although a number of pioneering frameworks for ensemble modeling have been published, the issue of generating informative priors has not yet been addressed. Here, we present a protocol that aims to fill this gap. This protocol discusses the collection of parameter values from a diverse range of sources (literature, databases and experiments), assessment of their plausibility, and creation of log-normal probability distributions that can be used as informative priors in ensemble modeling. Furthermore, the protocol enables sampling from the generated distributions while maintaining thermodynamic consistency. Once all parameter values have been retrieved from literature and databases, the protocol can be implemented within ~5-10 min per parameter. The aim of this protocol is to facilitate the design and use of informative distributions for ensemble modeling, especially in fields such as synthetic biology and systems medicine."

Although the genes involved in HR have been found in Trypanosoma brucei and studies have identified some of the proteins that participate in this HR pathway, the recruitment kinetics of the HR machinery onto DNA during DSB repair have not been clearly elucidated in this organism. Using immunofluorescence, protein DNA-bound assays, and DNA content analysis, we established the recruitment kinetics of the HR pathway in response to the DSBs generated by ionizing radiation (IR) in procyclic forms of T. brucei. These kinetics involved the phosphorylation of histone H2A and the sequential recruitment of the essential HR players Exo1, RPA, and Rad51. The process of DSB repair took approximately 5.5 hours. We found that DSBs led to a decline in the G2/M phase after IR treatment, concomitant with cell cycle arrest in the G1/S phase. This finding suggests that HR repairs DSBs faster than the other possible DSB repair processes that act during the G1/S transition. Taken together, these data suggest that the interplay between DNA damage detection and HR machinery recruitment is finely coordinated, allowing these parasites to repair DNA rapidly after DSBs during the late S/G2 proficient phases."

In the mammalian host, immune evasion of T. brucei bloodstream form (BSF) cells relies on antigenic variation, which includes monoallelic expression and periodic switching of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes. The active VSG is transcribed from only 1 of the 15 subtelomeric expression sites (ESs). During differentiation from BSF to the insect-resident procyclic form (PCF), the active ES is transcriptionally silenced. We used mass spectrometry-based interactomics to determine the composition of telomere protein complexes in T. brucei BSF and PCF stages to learn more about the structure and functions of telomeres in trypanosomes. Our data suggest a different telomere complex composition in the two forms of the parasite. One of the novel telomere-associated proteins, TelAP1, forms a complex with telomeric proteins TbTRF, TbRAP1 and TbTIF2 and influences ES silencing kinetics during developmental differentiation."

Given its role in epigenetics, the mechanistic basis for the strict monomethylation activity is under investigation. It is thought that PRMT7 enzymes are unable to add a second methyl group because of steric hindrance in the active site that restricts them to monomethylation. To test this, we probed the active site of trypanosomal PRMT7 (TbPRMT7) using accelerated molecular dynamics, site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic, binding, and product analyses. Both the dynamics simulations and experimental results show that the mutation of Phe71 to Ile converts the enzyme from a type III methyltransferase into a mixed type I/II, that is, an enzyme that can now perform dimethylation. In contrast, the serine and alanine mutants of Phe71 preserve the type III behavior of the native enzyme. These results are inconsistent with a sterics-only model to explain product specificity. Instead, molecular dynamics simulations of these variants bound to peptides show hydrogen bonding between would-be substrates and Glu172 of TbPRMT7. Only in the case of the Phe71 to Ile mutation is this interaction between MMA and the enzyme maintained, and the geometry for optimal S"

Using single-molecule FRET experiments on time scales from nanoseconds to milliseconds, we show that the unusual open-close kinetics results from slow sampling of an ensemble of disordered domain orientations. While substrate accelerates the kinetics, thus suggesting a substrate-induced switch to an alternative free energy landscape of the enzyme, the power-law behavior is also preserved upon electron load. Our results show that the slow sampling of open conformers is caused by a variety of interdomain interactions that imply a rugged free energy landscape, thus providing a generic mechanism for dynamic disorder in multidomain enzymes."

S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) is an essential enzyme in the polyamine pathway of T. brucei. Previous attempts to target this enzyme were thwarted by the lack of brain penetration of the most advanced series. Herein, we describe a T. brucei AdoMetDC inhibitor series based on a pyrimidineamine pharmacophore that we identified by target-based high-throughput screening. The pyrimidineamines showed selectivity for T. brucei AdoMetDC over the human enzyme, inhibited parasite growth in whole-cell assay, and had good predicted blood-brain barrier penetration. The medicinal chemistry program elucidated structure-activity relationships within the series. Features of the series that were required for binding were revealed by determining the X-ray crystal structure of TbAdoMetDC bound to one analog. The pyrimidineamine series provides a novel starting point for an anti-HAT lead optimization."

To investigate the reaction mechanism of ssOST, we recombinantly expressed, purified and characterized the STT3A protein from Trypanosoma brucei (TbSTT3A). We analyzed the in vitro activity of TbSTT3A by synthesizing fluorescently labeled acceptor peptides as well as lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) analogs containing a chitobiose moiety coupled to oligoprenyl carriers of distinct lengths (C10, C15, C20 and C25) and with different double bond stereochemistry. We found that in addition to proline, charged residues at the +1 position of the sequon inhibited glycan transfer. An acidic residue at the -2 position significantly increased catalytic turnover but was not essential, in contrast to the bacterial OST. While all synthetic LLO analogs were processed by TbSTT3A, the length of the polyprenyl tail, but not the stereochemistry of the double bonds, determined their apparent affinity.

Heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants identified cationic amino acid transporters among members of the T. brucei AAAP (amino acid/auxin permease) family. TbAAT5-3 showed high affinity arginine uptake (Km 3.6 ± 0.4 μM) and high selectivity for L-arginine. L-arginine transport was reduced by a 10-times excess of L-arginine, homo-arginine, canavanine or arginine-β-naphthylamide, while lysine was inhibitory only at 100-times excess, and histidine or ornithine did not reduce arginine uptake rates significantly. TbAAT16-1 is a high affinity (Km 4.3 ± 0.5 μM) and highly selective L-lysine transporter and of the compounds tested, only L-lysine and thialysine were competing for L-lysine uptake. TbAAT5-3 and TbAAT16-1 are expressed in both procyclic and bloodstream form T. brucei and cMyc-tagged proteins indicate localization at the plasma membrane. RNAi-mediated down-regulation of TbAAT5 and TbAAT16 in bloodstream form trypanosomes resulted in growth arrest, demonstrating that TbAAT5-mediated arginine and TbAAT16-mediated lysine transport are essential for T. brucei. Growth of induced RNAi lines could partially be rescued by supplementing a surplus of arginine or lysine, respectively, while addition of both amino acids was less efficient. Single and double RNAi lines indicate that additional low affinity uptake systems for arginine and lysine are present in T. brucei."

The 3' U-additions are catalyzed by terminal uridyltransferases (TUTases), a diverse group of enzymes that along with non-canonical poly(A) polymerases form a distinct group in the superfamily of DNA polymerase β-like nucleotidyl transferases. Within and across studied organisms and subcellular compartments, TUTases differ in nucleotide triphosphate selectivity, interacting partners, and RNA targets. A general premise linking RNA uridylation to 3'-5' degradation received support from several studies of small RNAs and mRNA turnover. However, recent work on kinetoplastid protists typified by Trypanosoma brucei provides evidence that RNA uridylation may play a more nuanced role in generating functional small RNAs. In this pathogen's mitochondrion, most mRNAs are internally edited by U-insertions and deletions, and subjected to 3' adenylation/uridylation; guide RNAs (gRNAs) required for editing are U-tailed. The prominent role of uridylation in mitochondrial RNA metabolism stimulated identification of the first TUTase, RNA editing TUTase 1 (RET1). Here we discuss functional studies of mitochondrial uridylation in trypanosomes that have revealed an unorthodox pathway of small RNA biogenesis. The current model accentuates physical coupling of RET1 and 3'-5' RNase II/RNB-type exonuclease DSS1 within a stable complex termed the mitochondrial 3' processome (MPsome). In the confines of this complex, RET1 initially uridylates a long precursor to activate its 3'-5' degradation by DSS1, and then uridylates trimmed guide RNA to disengage the processing complex from the mature molecule. We also discuss a potential role of antisense transcription in the MPsome pausing at a fixed distance from gRNA's 5' end. This step likely defines the mature 3' end by enabling kinetic competition between TUTase and exonuclease activities."

In conjunction with drug susceptibility and folate transport studies, RNAi knockdown was used to validate the functions of the putative folate transporters. The transport kinetics of folate and methotrexate were further characterized in whole cells. RNA interference target sequencing experiments identified a tandem array of genes encoding a folate transporter family, TbFT1-3, as major contributors to antifolate drug uptake. RNAi knockdown of TbFT1-3 substantially reduced folate transport into trypanosomes and reduced the parasite's susceptibly to the classical antifolates methotrexate and raltitrexed. In contrast, knockdown of TbFT1-3 increased susceptibly to the non-classical antifolates pyrimethamine and nolatrexed. Both folate and methotrexate transport were inhibited by classical antifolates but not by non-classical antifolates or biopterin. Thus, TbFT1-3 mediates the uptake of folate and classical antifolates in trypanosomes, and TbFT1-3 loss-of-function is a mechanism of antifolate drug resistance."

Uridylation plays a particularly prominent role in RNA processing pathways of kinetoplastid protists typified by the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, Trypanosoma brucei In mitochondria of this pathogen, most mRNAs are internally modified by U-insertion/deletion editing while guide RNAs and rRNAs are U-tailed. The founding member of TUTase family, RNA editing TUTase 1 (RET1), functions as a subunit of the 3' processome in uridylation of gRNA precursors and mature guide RNAs. Along with KPAP1 poly(A) polymerase, RET1 also participates in mRNA translational activation. RET1 is divergent from human TUTases and is essential for parasite viability in the mammalian host and the insect vector. Given its robust in vitro activity, RET1 represents an attractive target for trypanocide development. Here, we report high-resolution crystal structures of the RET1 catalytic core alone and in complex with UTP analogs. These structures reveal a tight docking of the conserved nucleotidyl transferase bi-domain module with a RET1-specific C2H2 zinc finger and RNA recognition (RRM) domains. Furthermore, we define RET1 region required for incorporation into the 3' processome, determinants for RNA binding, subunit oligomerization and processive UTP incorporation, and predict druggable pockets."

Here we report the kinetic properties and sensitivity of recombinant enzyme to a range of lipophilic and classical antifolate drugs. The purified recombinant enzyme, expressed as a fusion protein with elongation factor Ts (Tsf) in ThyA- Escherichia coli, retains DHFR activity, but lacks any TS activity. TS activity was found to be extremely unstable (half-life of 28 s) following desalting of clarified bacterial lysates to remove small molecules. Stability could be improved 700-fold by inclusion of dUMP, but not by other pyrimidine or purine (deoxy)-nucleosides or nucleotides. Inclusion of dUMP during purification proved insufficient to prevent inactivation during the purification procedure. Methotrexate and trimetrexate were the most potent inhibitors of DHFR (Ki 0.1 and 0.6 nM, respectively) and FdUMP and nolatrexed of TS (Ki 14 and 39 nM, respectively). All inhibitors showed a marked drop-off in potency of 100- to 1,000-fold against trypanosomes grown in low folate medium lacking thymidine. The most potent inhibitors possessed a terminal glutamate moiety suggesting that transport or subsequent retention by polyglutamylation was important for biological activity. Supplementation of culture medium with folate markedly antagonised the potency of these folate-like inhibitors, as did thymidine in the case of the TS inhibitors raltitrexed and pemetrexed."

SLPs are only encoded by the genomes of these parasitic protists and not by those of mammals, including human. Deletion of the Trypanosoma brucei SLP gene (TbSLP) increases the doubling time of procyclic T. brucei and causes a 5-fold reduction of de novo sterol biosynthesis from glucose- and acetate-derived acetyl-CoA. Fluorescence analyses of EGFP-tagged TbSLP expressed in the parasite located the TbSLP in the mitochondrion. The crystal structure of TbSLP (refined at 1.75 Å resolution) confirms that TbSLP has the canonical dimeric thiolase fold. In addition, the structures of the TbSLP-acetoacetyl-CoA (1.90 Å) and TbSLP-malonyl-CoA (2.30 Å) complexes reveal that the two oxyanion holes of the thiolase active site are preserved. TbSLP binds malonyl-CoA tightly (Kd 90 µM), acetoacetyl-CoA moderately (Kd 0.9 mM) and acetyl-CoA and CoA very weakly. TbSLP possesses low malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity. Altogether, the data show that TbSLP is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. Proteins 2016; 84:1075-1096. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

The technology is based on an automated protocol that simulates and quantifies the binding of small molecules towards a series of currently 16 proteins, known or suspected to trigger adverse effects. The simulations are conducted at the atomic level and explicitly allow for a mechanistic interpretation of the results (in real-time 3D/4D), thereby complying with the Setubal principles put forward in 2002 for computational approaches to toxicology. Moreover, the underlying ""ab-initio"" protocol is independent from any training data and makes the approach universal with respect to the applicability domain. The VirtualToxLab runs in client-server mode and is freely available to academic and non-profit organizations. As the underlying technology yields a thermodynamic estimate of the binding affinity, the associated ligand-protein complexes have been challenged by molecular-dynamics simulations to probe their kinetic stability. Human African trypanosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei. The control of this parasitic infection relies on a few chemotherapeutic agents, most of which were discovered decades ago and pose many challenges including adverse side effects, poor efficacy, and the occurrence of drug resistances. Natural products, on the other hand, offer a high potential for the discovery of new drug leads due to their chemical diversity. In this in silico study, we analyze a series of 89 natural products and derivatives displaying anti-trypanosomal activity for their potential to trigger adverse effects. Our results indicate a moderate potential for a number of those compounds to bind to nuclear receptors and thereby ease the development of endocrine disregulation. A few others would seem to inhibit enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family and, hence, sustain drug-drug interactions."

The thiol-dependent redox metabolism of trypanosomatids relies on bis-glutathionylspermidine [trypanothione, T(SH)2], a low molecular mass cosubstrate absent in the host. In pathogenic trypanosomatids, a single enzyme, trypanothione synthetase (TryS), catalyzes trypanothione biosynthesis, which is indispensable for parasite survival. Thus, TryS qualifies as an attractive drug target candidate.
A library composed of 144 compounds from 7 different families and several singletons was screened against TryS from three major pathogen species (Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania infantum). The screening conditions were adjusted to the TryS´ kinetic parameters and intracellular concentration of substrates corresponding to each trypanosomatid species, and/or to avoid assay interference. The screening assay yielded suitable Z' and signal to noise values (≥0.85 and ~3.5, respectively), and high intra-assay reproducibility. Several novel chemical scaffolds were identified as low μM and selective tri-tryp TryS inhibitors. Compounds displaying multi-TryS inhibition (N,N'-bis(3,4-substituted-benzyl) diamine derivatives) and an N5-substituted paullone (MOL2008) halted the proliferation of infective Trypanosoma brucei (EC50 in the nM range) and Leishmania infantum promastigotes (EC50 = 12 μM), respectively. A bis-benzyl diamine derivative and MOL2008 depleted intracellular trypanothione in treated parasites, which confirmed the on-target activity of these compounds.
Novel molecular scaffolds with on-target mode of action were identified as hit candidates for TryS inhibition. Due to the remarkable species-specificity exhibited by tri-tryp TryS towards the compounds, future optimization and screening campaigns should aim at designing and detecting, respectively, more potent and broad-range TryS inhibitors."

A protocol combining the use of directed capture using His-tagged PDE_CDs with covalent attachment to the SPR surface was developed.

The susceptibility of T. brucei brucei was assessed in vitro. The lowest effective concentration to inhibit growth (EC90) against drug-susceptible and -resistant parasites, time-kill kinetics, reversibility of inhibition and propensity for P-glycoprotein-mediated exclusion from the blood-brain barrier were determined.
Nitrofuran isoxazolines were potent inhibitors of T. brucei brucei proliferation at nanomolar concentrations, with pentacyclic nitrofurans being 100-fold more potent than nifurtimox. Activity was sustained against nifurtimox-resistant parasites, suggesting the possibility of a unique mechanism of activation and potential for use in the treatment of drug-resistant infections. Exposure of parasites to the maximum concentrations of Compound 15 achieved in vivo with oral dosing yielded >2 logs of irreversible killing in <4 h, indicating rapid trypanocidal activity.
Pentacyclic nitrofuran isoxazolines warrant further development for the treatment of drug-susceptible and nifurtimox-resistant trypanosome infections."

Quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase (QSOX) is a multidomain catalyst of disulfide-bond formation that relays electrons from substrate cysteines through two redox-active sites to molecular oxygen. The chemical steps in electron transfer have been delineated, but the conformational changes accompanying these steps are poorly characterized. Here we use single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to probe QSOX conformation in resting and cycling enzyme populations. We report the discovery of unanticipated roles for conformational changes in QSOX beyond mediating electron transfer between redox-active sites. In particular, a state of the enzyme not previously postulated or experimentally detected is shown to gate, via a conformational transition, the entrance into a sub-cycle within an expanded QSOX kinetic scheme. By tightly constraining mechanistic models, smFRET data can reveal the coupling between conformational and chemical transitions in complex enzymatic cycles."
1273,Protein kinase A signaling during bidirectional axenic differentiation in Leishmania.,10.1016/j.ijpara.2015.09.003,2015-10-16,"['Axenic culture', 'Development', 'Leishmania donovani', 'Protein kinase A', 'Protein phosphorylation', 'Stage differentiation']","Parasitic protozoa of the genus Leishmania are obligatory intracellular parasites that cycle between the phagolysosome of mammalian macrophages, where they proliferate as intracellular amastigotes, and the midgut of female sand flies, where they proliferate as extracellular promastigotes. Shifting between the two environments induces signaling pathway-mediated developmental processes that enable adaptation to both host and vector. Developmentally regulated expression and phosphorylation of protein kinase A subunits in Leishmania and in Trypanosoma brucei point to an involvement of protein kinase A in parasite development. To assess this hypothesis in Leishmania donovani, we determined proteome-wide changes in phosphorylation of the conserved protein kinase A phosphorylation motifs RXXS and RXXT, using a phospho-specific antibody. Rapid dephosphorylation of these motifs was observed upon initiation of promastigote to amastigote differentiation in culture. No phosphorylated sites were detected in axenic amastigotes. To analyse the kinetics of (re)phosphorylation during axenic reverse differentiation from L. donovani amastigotes to promastigotes, we first established a map of this process with morphological and molecular markers. Upon initiation, the parasites rested for 6-12 h before proliferation of an asynchronous population resumed. After early changes in cell shape, the major changes in molecular marker expression and flagella biogenesis occurred between 24 and 33 h after initiation. RXXS/T re-phosphorylation and expression of the regulatory subunit PKAR1 correlated with promastigote maturation, indicating a promastigote-specific function of protein kinase A signaling. This is supported by the localization of PKAR1 to the flagellum, an organelle reduced to a remnant in amastigote forms. We conclude that a significant increase in protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation is part of the ordered changes that characterise the amastigote to promastigote differentiation."

Without treatment the infection is almost always lethal. Current drugs for HAT are difficult to administer and have severe side effects. Together with increasing drug resistance this results in urgent need for new treatments. T. brucei and other trypanosomatid pathogens require a distinct form of post-transcriptional mRNA modification for mitochondrial gene expression. A multi-protein complex called the editosome cleaves mitochondrial mRNA, inserts or deletes uridine nucleotides at specific positions and re-ligates the mRNA. RNA editing ligase 1 (REL1) is essential for the re-ligation step and has no close homolog in the mammalian host, making it a promising target for drug discovery. However, traditional assays for RELs use radioactive substrates coupled with gel analysis and are not suitable for high-throughput screening of compound libraries. Here we describe a fluorescence-based REL activity assay. This assay is compatible with a 384-well microplate format and sensitive, satisfies statistical criteria for high-throughput methods and is readily adaptable for other polynucleotide ligases. We validated the assay by determining kinetic properties of REL1 and by identifying REL1 inhibitors in a library of small, pharmacologically active compounds."

Due to the dinucleoside triphosphatase activity, Fhits may also be involved in mRNA decapping. In the present study, we demonstrate Fhit-catalysed ammonolysis of adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate, which results in the formation of adenosine 5'-phosphoramidate. This reaction has previously been associated with adenylylsulfate-ammonia adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.51).

No cross-reactivity was detected with phosphatidylethanolamine. Only PlyA2 also associated with CPE, independent of Chol content (K(D) = 41 μM), rendering it a suitable tool for visualizing CPE in lipid-blotting experiments and biologic samples from sterol auxotrophic organisms.

All 21 in vitro hits were used in a subsequent similarity search-based in silico screening on a database containing 200,000 physically available compounds. The similarity search resulted in a data set containing 1,204 potential TR inhibitors, which was subjected to a second in vitro screening campaign leading to 61 additional active compounds.

In total, 82 novel TR inhibitors with activities down to the nM range could be identified proving the validity of our combined in vitro/in silico approach.

LmTK efficiently phosphorylates dThd and dUrd and has high structural homology to TKs from other species. However, it significantly differs in its kinetic properties from Trypanosoma brucei TK since purines are not substrates of the enzyme and dNTPs such as dUTP inhibit LmTK. The enzyme had Km and kcat values for dThd of 1.1 μM and 2.62 s(-1) and exhibits cooperative binding for ATP. Additionally, we show that the anti-retroviral prodrug zidovudine (3-azido-3-deoxythymidine, AZT) and 5'-modified dUrd can be readily phosphorylated by LmTK. The production of recombinant enzyme at a level suitable for structural studies was achieved by the construction of C-terminal truncated versions of the enzyme and the use of a baculoviral expression system. The structures of the catalytic core of LmTK in complex with dThd, the negative feedback regulator dTTP and the bi-substrate analogue AP5dT, were determined to 2.74, 3.00 and 2.40 Å, respectively, and provide the structural basis for exclusion of purines and dNTP inhibition. The results will aid the process of rational drug design with LmTK as a potential target for anti-leishmanial drugs."

We here describe the heterologous expression, purification, and characterization of recombinant Trypanosoma brucei methionine aminopeptidase, type 1 (TbMetAP1). We investigated the dependency of TbMetAP1 activity on pH and metal cofactor (type and concentration) using in particular the substrates Met-Gly-Met-Met and Met-AMC along with related compounds, and determined kinetic values (Km, vmax, kcat). The optimal pH for TbMetAP1 activity is between 7.0 and 8.0. Surprisingly, the two substrates have different cofactor requirements: Both substrates are processed by the cobalt-activated TbMetAP1, but only the Met-Gly-Met-Met substrate is processed with nearly identical catalytical properties by the zinc-activated enzyme. Depending on the substrate, various other metal ions (iron(II), manganese, nickel) were also accepted as cofactors. Two aspects of this work are relevant for the biochemistry of MetAPs and further drug discovery efforts: 1. Zinc, and not cobalt ions are probably the physiological cofactor of TbMetAP1 and possibly other MetAPs. 2. In MetAP assays for compound screening, the combination of the Met-AMC substrate with cobalt, manganese or iron ions may not represent the physiological reality, thereby leading to results that can not be extrapolated towards a phenotypic effect."

Branching from the traditional respiratory chain at the quinone pool, AOX is responsible for cyanide-resistant respiration in plants and fungi, heat generation in thermogenic plants, and survival of parasites, such as Trypanosoma brucei, in the human host. A recently solved AOX structure provides insight into its active site, thereby facilitating rational phytopathogenic and antiparasitic drug design. Here, we describe expression of recombinant AOX using two different expression systems. Purification protocols for the production of highly pure and stable AOX protein in sufficient quantities to facilitate further kinetic, biophysical, and structural analyses are also described."

Here, we have investigated the presence of NTPDase in the genome of Trypanosoma evansi. Based on the genomic sequence from Trypanosoma brucei, we have amplified an 1812 gene fragment corresponding to the T. evansi NTPDase gene. The protein was expressed in the soluble form and purified to homogeneity and enzymatic assays were performed confirming the enzyme identity. Kinetic parameters and substrate specificity were determined. The dependence of cations on enzymatic activity was investigated indicating the enzyme is stimulated by divalent cations and carbohydrates but inhibited by sodium. Bioinformatic analysis indicates the enzyme is a membrane bound protein facing the extracellular side of the cell with 98% identity to the T. brucei homologous NTPDase gene."

In Trypanosoma brucei, several transporters have been implicated in uptake of the main classes of drugs, diamidines and melaminophenyl arsenicals. The resistance mechanism had been thought to be due to loss of a transporter known to carry both types of agents: the aminopurine transporter P2, encoded by the gene TbAT1. However, although loss of P2 activity is well-documented as the cause of resistance to the veterinary diamidine diminazene aceturate (DA; Berenil(®)), cross-resistance between the human-use arsenical melarsoprol and the diamidine pentamidine (melarsoprol/pentamidine cross resistance, MPXR) is the result of loss of a separate high affinity pentamidine transporter (HAPT1). A genome-wide RNAi library screen for resistance to pentamidine, published in 2012, gave the key to the genetic identity of HAPT1 by linking the phenomenon to a locus that contains the closely related T. brucei aquaglyceroporin genes TbAQP2 and TbAQP3. Further analysis determined that knockdown of only one pore, TbAQP2, produced the MPXR phenotype. TbAQP2 is an unconventional aquaglyceroporin with unique residues in the ""selectivity region"" of the pore, and it was found that in several MPXR lab strains the WT gene was either absent or replaced by a chimeric protein, recombined with parts of TbAQP3. Importantly, wild-type AQP2 was also absent in field isolates of T. b. gambiense, correlating with the outcome of melarsoprol treatment. Expression of a wild-type copy of TbAQP2 in even the most resistant strain completely reversed MPXR and re-introduced HAPT1 function and transport kinetics. Expression of TbAQP2 in Leishmania mexicana introduced a pentamidine transport activity indistinguishable from HAPT1. Although TbAQP2 has been shown to function as a classical aquaglyceroporin it is now clear that it is also a high affinity drug transporter, HAPT1. We discuss here a possible structural rationale for this remarkable ability."
1285,Functional analysis of drug resistance-associated mutations in the Trypanosoma brucei adenosine transporter 1 (TbAT1) and the proposal of a structural model for the protein.,10.1111/mmi.12979,2015-02-25,[],"The Trypanosoma brucei aminopurine transporter P2/TbAT1 has long been implicated in the transport of, and resistance to, the diamidine and melaminophenyl arsenical classes of drugs that form the backbone of the pharmacopoeia against African trypanosomiasis. Genetic alterations including deletions and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been observed in numerous strains and clinical isolates. Here, we systematically investigate each reported mutation and assess their effects on transporter function after expression in a tbat1(-/-) T. brucei line. Out of a set of six reported SNPs from a reported 'resistance allele', none significantly impaired sensitivity to pentamidine, diminazene or melarsoprol, relative to the TbAT1-WT allele, although several combinations, and the deletion of the codon for residue F316, resulted in highly significant impairment. These combinations of SNPs, and ΔF316, also strongly impaired the uptake of [(3)H]-adenosine and [(3)H]-diminazene, identical to the tbat1(-/-) control. The TbAT1 protein model predicted that residues F19, D140 and F316 interact with the substrate of the transporter. Mutation of D140 to alanine resulted in an inactive transporter, whereas the mutation F19A produced a transporter with a slightly increased affinity for [(3)H]-diminazene but reduced the uptake rate. The results presented here validate earlier hypotheses of drug binding motifs for TbAT1."

A recent genome-wide analysis of Trypanosoma brucei, the etiological agent of sleeping sickness, localized its replication origins to the boundaries of multigenic transcription units. To better understand genomic replication in this organism, we examined replication by single molecule analysis of replicated DNA. We determined the average speed of replication forks of procyclic and bloodstream form cells and we found that T. brucei DNA replication rate is similar to rates seen in other eukaryotes. We also analyzed the replication dynamics of a central region of chromosome 1 in procyclic forms. We present evidence for replication terminating within the central part of the chromosome and thus emanating from both sides, suggesting a previously unmapped origin toward the 5' extremity of chromosome 1. Also, termination is not at a fixed location in chromosome 1, but is rather variable. Importantly, we found a replication origin located near an ORC1/CDC6 binding site that is detected after replicative stress induced by hydroxyurea treatment, suggesting it may be a dormant origin activated in response to replicative stress. Collectively, our findings support the existence of more replication origins in T. brucei than previously appreciated."

The critical nature of the G-1 residue is underscored by the fact that two entirely distinct mechanisms for its acquisition are observed, with cotranscriptional incorporation observed in Bacteria, while post-transcriptional addition of G-1 occurs in Eukarya. Here, through our investigation of eukaryotes that lack obvious homologs of the post-transcriptional G-1-addition enzyme Thg1, we identify alternative pathways to tRNA(His) identity that controvert these well-established rules. We demonstrate that Trypanosoma brucei, like Acanthamoeba castellanii, lacks the G-1 identity element on tRNA(His) and utilizes a noncanonical G-1-independent histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS). Purified HisRS enzymes from A. castellanii and T. brucei exhibit a mechanism of tRNA(His) recognition that is distinct from canonical G-1-dependent synthetases. Moreover, noncanonical HisRS enzymes genetically complement the loss of THG1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, demonstrating the biological relevance of the G-1-independent aminoacylation activity. In contrast, in Caenorhabditis elegans, which is another Thg1-independent eukaryote, the G-1 residue is maintained, but here its acquisition is noncanonical. In this case, the G-1 is encoded and apparently retained after 5' end processing, which has so far only been observed in Bacteria and organelles. Collectively, these observations unearth a widespread and previously unappreciated diversity in eukaryotic tRNA(His) identity mechanisms."
1288,Triacylglycerol Storage in Lipid Droplets in Procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1371/journal.pone.0114628,2014-12-11,[],"Carbon storage is likely to enable adaptation of trypanosomes to nutritional challenges or bottlenecks during their stage development and migration in the tsetse. Lipid droplets are candidates for this function. This report shows that feeding of T. brucei with oleate results in a 4-5 fold increase in the number of lipid droplets, as quantified by confocal fluorescence microscopy and by flow cytometry of BODIPY 493/503-stained cells. The triacylglycerol (TAG) content also increased 4-5 fold, and labeled oleate is incorporated into TAG. Fatty acid carbon can thus be stored as TAG in lipid droplets under physiological growth conditions in procyclic T. brucei. β-oxidation has been suggested as a possible catabolic pathway for lipids in T. brucei. A single candidate gene, TFEα1 with coding capacity for a subunit of the trifunctional enzyme complex was identified. TFEα1 is expressed in procyclic T. brucei and present in glycosomal proteomes, Unexpectedly, a TFEα1 gene knock-out mutant still expressed wild-type levels of previously reported NADP-dependent 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, and therefore, another gene encodes this enzymatic activity. Homozygous Δtfeα1/Δtfeα1 null mutant cells show a normal growth rate and an unchanged glycosomal proteome in procyclic T. brucei. The decay kinetics of accumulated lipid droplets upon oleate withdrawal can be fully accounted for by the dilution effect of cell division in wild-type and Δtfeα1/Δtfeα1 cells. The absence of net catabolism of stored TAG in procyclic T. brucei, even under strictly glucose-free conditions, does not formally exclude a flux through TAG, in which biosynthesis equals catabolism. Also, the possibility remains that TAG catabolism is completely repressed by other carbon sources in culture media or developmentally activated in post-procyclic stages in the tsetse."
1289,"Evolution, dynamics and specialized functions of glycosomes in metabolism and development of trypanosomatids.",10.1016/j.mib.2014.09.006,2014-12-03,[],"Kinetoplastea such as trypanosomatid parasites contain specialized peroxisomes that uniquely contain enzymes of the glycolytic pathway and other parts of intermediary metabolism and hence are called glycosomes. Their specific enzyme content can vary strongly, quantitatively and qualitatively, between different species and during the parasites’ life cycle. The correct sequestering of enzymes has great importance for the regulation of the trypanosomatids’ metabolism and can, dependent on environmental conditions, even be essential. Glycosomes also play a pivotal role in life-cycle regulation of Trypanosoma brucei, as the translocation of a protein phosphatase from the cytosol forms part of a crucial developmental control switch. Many glycosomal proteins are differentially phosphorylated in different life-cycle stages, possibly indicative for unique forms of activity regulation, whereas many kinetic activity regulation mechanisms common for glycolytic enzymes are absent in these organisms. Glycosome turnover occurs by autophagic degradation of redundant organelles and assembly of new ones. This may provide the trypanosomatids with a manner to rapidly and efficiently adapt their metabolism to the sudden, major nutritional changes often encountered during the life cycle. This could also have helped facilitating successful adaptation of kinetoplastids, at multiple occasions during evolution, to their parasitic life style."

However, the Trypanosoma brucei genome encodes only the last two steps in this pathway: homoserine kinase (HSK) and threonine synthase. Here, we investigated the possible roles for this incomplete pathway through biochemical, genetic and nutritional studies. Purified recombinant TbHSK specifically phosphorylates L-homoserine and displays kinetic properties similar to other HSKs. HSK null mutants generated in bloodstream forms displayed no growth phenotype in vitro or loss of virulence in vivo. However, following transformation into procyclic forms, homoserine, homoserine lactone and certain acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) were found to substitute for threonine in growth media for wild-type procyclics, but not HSK null mutants. The tsetse fly is considered to be an unlikely source of these nutrients as it feeds exclusively on mammalian blood. Bioinformatic studies predict that tsetse endosymbionts possess part (up to homoserine in Wigglesworthia glossinidia) or all of the β-aspartyl phosphate pathway (Sodalis glossinidius). In addition S. glossinidius is known to produce 3-oxohexanoylhomoserine lactone which also supports trypanosome growth. We propose that T. brucei has retained HSK and threonine synthase in order to salvage these nutrients when threonine availability is limiting."

Arginine kinase of trypanosome has been validated as target for drug development against trypanosomiasis. The present study investigated the interaction between a recombinant form of the arginine kinase (rTbAK) of trypanosome and gallotannin. The interaction between gallotannin and recombinant arginine kinase of Trypanosoma brucei caused significant decrease of enzyme activity. Kinetic analysis revealed the interaction to be of noncompetitive inhibition. Further thermodynamic analysis showed that the interaction between gallotannin and the recombinant arginine kinase was nonspontaneous and involved hydrophobic forces. The K sv values and the FRET analysis suggest that static quenching of fluorescence intensity by gallotannin was static. Data revealed inhibitory interactions between gallotannin and rTbAK of trypanosome. Although the mechanism of inhibition is not clear yet, molecular docking studies are ongoing to clearly define the inhibitory interactions between the gallotannin and rTbAK. The knowledge of such binding properties would enrich development of selective inhibitors for the arginine kinase of Trypanosoma brucei."

Our study aimed at evaluating red-shifted luciferases for in vivo BLI in a set of diverse T.b. strains of all three subspecies, including some recently isolated from human patients.
We transfected T.b. brucei, T.b. rhodesiense and T.b. gambiense strains with either RLuc, click beetle red (CBR) or Photinus pyralis RE9 (PpyRE9) luciferase and characterised their in vitro luciferase activity, growth profile and drug sensitivity, and their potential for in vivo BLI. Compared to RLuc, the red-shifted luciferases, CBR and PpyRE9, allow tracking of T.b. brucei AnTaR 1 trypanosomes with higher details on tissue distribution, and PpyRE9 allows detection of the parasites with a sensitivity of at least one order of magnitude higher than CBR luciferase. With CBR-tagged T.b. gambiense LiTaR1, T.b. rhodesiense RUMPHI and T.b. gambiense 348 BT in an acute, subacute and chronic infection model respectively, we observed differences in parasite tropism for murine tissues during in vivo BLI. Ex vivo BLI on the brain confirmed central nervous system infection by all luminescent strains of T.b. brucei AnTaR 1, T.b. rhodesiense RUMPHI and T.b. gambiense 348 BT.
We established a genetically and phenotypically diverse collection of bioluminescent T.b. brucei, T.b. gambiense and T.b. rhodesiense strains, including drug resistant strains. For in vivo BLI monitoring of murine infections, we recommend trypanosome strains transfected with red-shifted luciferase reporter genes, such as CBR and PpyRE9. Red-shifted luciferases can be detected with a higher sensitivity in vivo and at the same time they improve the spatial resolution of the parasites in the entire body due to the better kinetics of their substrate D-luciferin."

In protein disulfide isomerase-first (PDI-first) pathways of oxidative protein folding, PDI is the immediate oxidant of reduced client proteins and then addresses disulfide mispairings in a second isomerization phase. In PDI-second pathways the initial oxidation is PDI-independent. Evidence for the rapid reduction of PDI by reduced glutathione is presented in the context of PDI-first pathways. Strategies and challenges are discussed for determination of the concentrations of reduced and oxidized glutathione and of the ratios of PDI(red):PDI(ox). The preponderance of evidence suggests that the mammalian ER is more reducing than first envisaged. The average redox state of major PDI-family members is largely to almost totally reduced. These observations are consistent with model studies showing that oxidative protein folding proceeds most efficiently at a reducing redox poise consistent with a stoichiometric insertion of disulfides into client proteins. After a discussion of the use of natively encoded fluorescent probes to report the glutathione redox poise of the ER, this review concludes with an elaboration of a complementary strategy to discontinuously survey the redox state of as many redox-active disulfides as can be identified by ratiometric LC-MS-MS methods. Consortia of oxidoreductases that are in redox equilibrium can then be identified and compared to the glutathione redox poise of the ER to gain a more detailed understanding of the factors that influence oxidative protein folding within the secretory compartment."

Recent high-throughput analyses, combined with mathematical modelling, have demonstrated possibilities for transcript-specific regulation at every stage: trans splicing, polyadenylation, translation, and degradation of both the precursor and the mature mRNA. Different mRNA degradation pathways result in different types of degradation kinetics. The original idea that the fate of an mRNA - or even just its degradation kinetics - can be defined by a single ""regulatory element"" is an over-simplification. It is now clear that every mRNA can bind many different proteins, some of which may compete with each other. Superimposed upon this complexity are the interactions of those proteins with effectors of gene expression. The amount of protein that is made from a gene is therefore determined by a complex network of interactions."

The latter 2 compounds promoted time- and dose-dependent formation of methemoglobin when incubated in whole human blood, but such levels were below those typically required to produce symptoms of methemoglobinemia in humans.

These parasitic protozoa exhibit a unique thiol redox metabolism that is based on the flavoenzyme trypanothione reductase (TR). TR was identified as a potential drug target and features a large active site that allows a multitude of possible ligand orientations, which renders rational structure-based inhibitor design highly challenging. Herein we describe the synthesis, binding properties, and kinetic analysis of a new series of small-molecule inhibitors of TR. The conjunction of biological activities, mutation studies, and virtual ligand docking simulations led to the prediction of a binding mode that was confirmed by crystal structure analysis. The crystal structures revealed that the ligands bind to the hydrophobic wall of the so-called ""mepacrine binding site"".

All the data obtained with TcoCBc1 were compared with those of human cathepsin B, including the pH profiles of the hydrolytic reactions. The most relevant observation is the preference of TcoCBc1 for substrates with a pair of acidic amino acids at positions P(2) and P(1) for its carboxydipeptidase activity and the well acceptance for E and D at P(1) position for endopeptidase activity. These peculiar preferences for negatively charged groups of TcoCBc1 and its requirements for carboxydipeptidase activity were also observed on Abz labeled analogues of bradykinin (Abz-RPPG(↓)FSAFR-OH, Abz-RPPG(↓)FS(↓)AF-OH, Abz-RPPG(↓)DE(↓)AF-OH) and angiotensin I (Abz-DR(↓)VYIHAFHL-OH), where (↓) indicates the cleavage site. TcoCBc1 was modeled based on the atomic coordinates of the cathepsin B from Trypanosoma brucei and the positively charged environment in TcoCBc1 catalytic site contrasts with the negatively charged environment in human cathepsin B. The preferences of S1 and S2 subsites of TcoCBc1 for acidic amino acids have to be taken into consideration for future studies of physiological roles of TcoCBc1 as for instance in apoptotic processes of Trypanosoma congolense."

One is the ammonia-utilizing asparagine synthetase A (AsnA), and the other is asparagine synthetase B (AsnB) that uses glutamine or ammonia as a nitrogen source. In a previous investigation using sequence-based analysis, we had shown that Leishmania spp. possess asparagine-tRNA synthetase paralog asparagine synthetase A (LdASNA) that is ammonia-dependent. Here, we report the cloning, expression, and kinetic analysis of ASNA from Leishmania donovani. Interestingly, LdASNA was both ammonia- and glutamine-dependent. To study the physiological role of ASNA in Leishmania, gene deletion mutations were attempted via targeted gene replacement. Gene deletion of LdASNA showed a growth delay in mutants. However, chromosomal null mutants of LdASNA could not be obtained as the double transfectant mutants showed aneuploidy. These data suggest that LdASNA is essential for survival of the Leishmania parasite. LdASNA enzyme was recalcitrant toward crystallization so we instead crystallized and solved the atomic structure of its close homolog from Trypanosoma brucei (TbASNA) at 2.2 Å. A very significant conservation in active site residues is observed between TbASNA and Escherichia coli AsnA. It is evident that the absence of an LdASNA homolog from humans and its essentiality for the parasites make LdASNA a novel drug target."

The pKa of these residues in free and substrate bound enzymes has been determined measuring by ITC the proton release/uptake induced by substrate binding at different pH values. Wt 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma brucei and two active site enzyme mutants, K185H and E192Q were investigated. Substrate binding was accompanied by proton release and was dependent on the ionization of a group with pKa 7.07 which was absent in the E192Q mutant. Kinetic data highlighted two pKa, 7.17 and 9.64, in the enzyme-substrate complex, the latter being absent in the E192Q mutant, suggesting that the substrate binding shifts Glu192 pKa from 7.07 to 9.64. A comparison of wt and E192Q mutant appears to show that the substrate binding shifts Lys185 pKa from 9.9 to 7.17. By comparing differences in proton release and the binding enthalpy of wt and mutant enzymes, the enthalpic cost of the change in the protonation state of Lys185 and Glu192 was estimated at ≈6.1kcal/mol. The change in protonation state of Lys185 and Glu192 has little effect on Gibbs free energy, 240-325cal/mol. However proton balance evidences the dissociation of other group(s) that can be collectively described by a single pKa shift from 9.1 to 7.54. This further change in ionization state of the enzyme causes an increase of free energy with a total cost of 1.2-2.3kcal/mol to set the enzyme into a catalytically competent form."

The genome of the parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma brucei (the causative agent of African sleeping sickness) encodes five metacaspases: TbMCA1-TbMCA5. Of these TbMCA2, TbMCA3, and TbMCA5 are active cysteine peptidases expressed in the bloodstream form of the parasite. To investigate the structure-function relationship of the trypanosome metacaspases and the structural basis for their divergence from the caspases, paracaspases, and other Clan CD cysteine peptidases (or vice versa), we purified and characterized TbMCA2 and determined the three-dimensional structure of an inactive mutant using X-ray crystallography. The methods presented in this chapter describe the recombinant expression of active TbMCA2 and inactive TbMCA2(C213A). The protocols produce large amounts of recombinant protein for use in structural, biochemical, and kinetic studies and include detailed information on how to produce diffraction quality crystals of TbMCA2(C213A)."

The enzyme that catalyses this reaction, NMT (N-myristoyltransferase), has been pharmacologically validated as a drug target in the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei. In the present study, we evaluate NMT as a potential drug target in Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, using chemical and genetic approaches. Replacement of both allelic copies of TcNMT (T. cruzi NMT) was only possible in the presence of a constitutively expressed ectopic copy of the gene, indicating that this gene is essential for survival of T. cruzi epimastigotes. The pyrazole sulphonamide NMT inhibitor DDD85646 is 13-23-fold less potent against recombinant TcNMT than TbNMT (T. brucei NMT), with Ki values of 12.7 and 22.8 nM respectively, by scintillation proximity or coupled assay methods. DDD85646 also inhibits growth of T. cruzi epimastigotes (EC50=6.9 μM), but is ~1000-fold less potent than that reported for T. brucei. On-target activity is demonstrated by shifts in cell potency in lines that over- and under-express NMT and by inhibition of intracellular N-myristoylation of several proteins in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, our findings suggest that N-myristoylation is an essential and druggable target in T. cruzi."

Determination of the potentials of the redox centers in Trypanosoma brucei QSOX provides a context for understanding catalysis by this facile oxidant of protein thiols. The CXXC motif of the thioredoxin domain is comparatively oxidizing (E'0 of -144 mV), consistent with an ability to transfer disulfide bonds to a broad range of thiol substrates. In contrast, the proximal CXXC disulfide in the ERV (essential for respiration and vegetative growth) domain of TbQSOX is strongly reducing (E'0 of -273 mV), representing a major apparent thermodynamic barrier to overall catalysis. Reduction of the oxidizing FAD cofactor (E'0 of -153 mV) is followed by the strongly favorable reduction of molecular oxygen. The role of a mixed disulfide intermediate between thioredoxin and ERV domains was highlighted by rapid reaction studies in which the wild-type CGAC motif in the thioredoxin domain of TbQSOX was replaced by the more oxidizing CPHC or more reducing CGPC sequence. Mixed disulfide bond formation is accompanied by the generation of a charge transfer complex with the flavin cofactor. This provides thermodynamic coupling among the three redox centers of QSOX and avoids the strongly uphill mismatch between the formal potentials of the thioredoxin and ERV disulfides. This work identifies intriguing mechanistic parallels between the eukaryotic QSOX enzymes and the DsbA/B system catalyzing disulfide bond generation in the bacterial periplasm and suggests that the strategy of linked disulfide exchanges may be exploited in other catalysts of oxidative protein folding."

The reaction is typified by the insertion and deletion of U nucleotides and is catalyzed by a macromolecular complex, the editosome. Editosomes bind pre-edited mRNA/gRNA pairs and the reaction can be recapitulated in vitro by using pre-mRNA- and gRNA-mimicking oligoribonucleotides together with enriched editosome preparations. Although the in vitro assay has been instrumental in unraveling the basic steps of the editing cycle it is performed at dilute solvent conditions. This ignores the fact that editing takes place inside the highly crowded mitochondria. Here we investigate the effects of molecular crowding on RNA editing. By using neutral, macromolecular cosolutes we generate defined dilute, semidilute and crowded solvent properties and we demonstrate different thermodynamic stabilities of the pre-mRNA/gRNA hybrid RNAs at these conditions. Crowded conditions stabilize the RNAs by -30 kJ/mol. Furthermore, we show that the rate constants for the association and dissociation (kass/kdiss) of substrate RNAs to editosomes decrease, ultimately inhibiting the in vitro reaction. The data demonstrate that the current RNA editing in vitro system is sensitive to molecular crowding, which suggests that the in vivo reaction cannot rely on a diffusion-controlled, collision-based mechanism. Possible non-diffusional reaction pathways are discussed."

Some of these enzymes were localized to the cytoplasm or mitochondrion, but most were dually localized to both cellular compartments. Cytoplasmic T. brucei aaRSs were organized in a multiprotein complex in both bloodstream and procyclic forms. The multiple aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (MARS) complex contained at least six aaRS enzymes and three additional non-aaRS proteins. Steady-state kinetic studies showed that association in the MARS complex enhances tRNA-aminoacylation efficiency, which is in part dependent on a MARS complex-associated protein (MCP), named MCP2, that binds tRNAs and increases their aminoacylation by the complex. Conditional repression of MCP2 in T. brucei bloodstream forms resulted in reduced parasite growth and infectivity in mice. Thus, association in a MARS complex enhances tRNA-aminoacylation and contributes to parasite fitness. The MARS complex may be part of a cellular regulatory system and a target for drug development."

The interaction of the enzyme with silver and gold nanoparticles showed a non-competitive inhibition with, respectively, 75% and 62% decrease in activity; Ki values ranged from 1.5 nM (Ag) to 3.1 nM (Au). A mechanism for this inhibition was by interaction with Cys(271) positioned 3.3 Å from the reactive NH(1) of substrate arginine.

A critique of current treatments for stage 2 HAT is included to provide context for the challenges of achieving target tissue disposition and the need for establishing pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) measures early in the discovery paradigm. The strategy comprises 3 stages. Initially, compounds demonstrating promising in vitro activity and selectivity for the target organism over mammalian cells are advanced to in vitro metabolic stability, barrier permeability and tissue binding assays to establish that they will likely achieve and maintain therapeutic concentrations during in-life efficacy studies. Secondly, in vitro time-kill and reversibility kinetics are employed to correlate exposure (based on unbound concentrations) with in vitro activity, and to identify pharmacodynamic measures that would best predict efficacy. Lastly, this information is used to design dosing regimens for pivotal pharmacokinetic-pharmacodyamic studies in animal infection models."

For trypanosomatid parasites, this is mediated by type I nitroreductases. Here, we demonstrate that the causative agent of leishmaniasis, Leishmania major, expresses an FMN-containing nitroreductase (LmNTR) that metabolizes a wide range of substrates, and based on electron donor and acceptor preferences, it may function as an NADH:quinone oxidoreductase. Using gene deletion approaches, we demonstrate that this activity is essential to L. major promastigotes, the parasite forms found in the insect vector. Intriguingly, LmNTR(+/-) heterozygote promastigote parasites could readily differentiate into infectious metacyclic cells but these were unable to establish infections in cultured mammalian cells and caused delayed pathology in mice. Furthermore, we exploit the LmNTR activity evaluating a library of nitrobenzylphosphoramide mustards using biochemical and phenotypic screens. We identify a subset of compounds that display significant growth inhibitory properties against the intracellular parasite form found in the mammalian hosts. The leishmanicidal activity was shown to be LmNTR-specific as the LmNTR(+/-) heterozygote promastigotes displayed resistance to the most potent mustards. We conclude that LmNTR can be targeted for drug development by exploiting its prodrug activating property or by designing specific inhibitors to block its endogenous function."

Trypanosomes are purine auxotrophs and their uptake pathway has long been appreciated as an attractive target for drug design. Recently, one tight-binding competitive inhibitor of the trypanosomal purine-specific nucleoside hydrolase (IAGNH) showed remarkable trypanocidal activity in a murine model of infection. Here, the enzymatic characterization of T. brucei brucei IAGNH is presented, together with its high-resolution structures in the unliganded form and in complexes with different inhibitors, including the trypanocidal compound UAMC-00363. A description of the crucial contacts that account for the high-affinity inhibition of IAGNH by iminoribitol-based compounds is provided and the molecular mechanism underlying the conformational change necessary for enzymatic catalysis is identified. It is demonstrated for the first time that metalorganic complexes can compete for binding at the active site of nucleoside hydrolase enzymes, mimicking the positively charged transition state of the enzymatic reaction. Moreover, we show that divalent metal ions can act as noncompetitive IAGNH inhibitors, stabilizing a nonproductive conformation of the catalytic loop.

Biophysical characterization of the UAP enzyme kinetics revealed that the human and trypanosome enzymes both display a strictly ordered bi-bi mechanism, but with the order of substrate binding reversed. Structural characterization of the T. brucei UAP-inhibitor complex revealed that the inhibitor binds at an allosteric site absent in the human homologue that prevents the conformational rearrangement required to bind UTP.

Here we present a thorough kinetic analysis of Trypanosoma brucei TryS in a newly developed phosphate buffer system at pH 7.0 and 37 °C, mimicking the physiological environment of the enzyme in the cytosol of bloodstream parasites. Under these conditions, TryS displays Km values for GSH, ATP, spermidine, and Gsp of 34, 18, 687, and 32 μm, respectively, as well as Ki values for GSH and T(SH)2 of 1 mm and 360 μm, respectively. As Gsp hydrolysis has a Km value of 5.6 mm, the in vivo amidase activity is probably negligible. To obtain deeper insight in the molecular mechanism of TryS, we have formulated alternative kinetic models, with elementary reaction steps represented by linear kinetic equations. The model parameters were fitted to the extensive matrix of steady-state data obtained for different substrate/product combinations under the in vivo-like conditions. The best model describes the full kinetic profile and is able to predict time course data that were not used for fitting. This system's biology approach to enzyme kinetics led us to conclude that (i) TryS follows a ter-reactant mechanism, (ii) the intermediate Gsp dissociates from the enzyme between the two catalytic steps, and (iii) T(SH)2 inhibits the enzyme by remaining bound at its product site and, as does the inhibitory GSH, by binding to the activated enzyme complex. The newly detected concerted substrate and product inhibition suggests that TryS activity is tightly regulated."

We now show that T. brucei procyclic forms in culture readily incorporate [(3)H]-labeled choline into PC, indicating that trypanosomes express a transporter for choline at the plasma membrane. Characterization of the transport system in T. brucei procyclic and bloodstream forms shows that uptake of choline is independent of sodium and potassium ions and occurs with a Km in the low micromolar range. In addition, we demonstrate that choline uptake can be blocked by the known choline transport inhibitor, hemicholinium-3, and by synthetic choline analogs that have been established as anti-malarials. Together, our results show that T. brucei parasites express an uptake system for choline and that exogenous choline is used for PC synthesis."

However, current therapeutic options are severely limited and there is a desperate need for new compounds to treat the disease. Whole-cell high-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique frequently used to identify compounds with trypanocidal activity.
The authors examine the development of whole-organism HTS assays for T.b. brucei. The authors describe the successes achieved through HTS and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of whole-organism HTS.
Despite hundreds of trypanocidal molecules being identified by whole-organism HTS, very few have progressed into preclinical development. The failure of molecules identified by HTS to progress along the drug development pathway is due to a multitude of factors including undrug-like molecules and molecules having poor pharmacodynamics/kinetic properties. Future studies should focus on screening libraries that contain drug-like molecules that possess some of the properties required in the final compound."

To investigate the extended substrate specificity and effects of Ca(2+) on the activation of these enzymes, detailed kinetic, biochemical and structural analyses were carried out on metacaspase 2 from Trypanosoma brucei (TbMCA2). These results reveal that TbMCA2 has an unambiguous preference for basic amino acids at the P1 position of peptide substrates and that this is most probably a result of hydrogen bonding from the P1 residue to Asp95 and Asp211 in TbMCA2. In addition, TbMCA2 also has a preference for charged residues at the P2 and P3 positions and for small residues at the prime side of a peptide substrate. Studies into the effects of Ca(2+) on the enzyme revealed the presence of two Ca(2+) binding sites and a reversible structural modification of the enzyme upon Ca(2+) binding. In addition, the concentration of Ca(2+) used for activation of TbMCA2 was found to produce a differential effect on the activity of TbMCA2, but only when a series of peptides that differed in P2 were examined, suggesting that Ca(2+) activation of TbMCA2 has a structural effect on the enzyme in the vicinity of the S2 binding pocket. Collectively, these data give new insights into the substrate specificity and Ca(2+) activation of TbMCA2. This provides important functional details and leads to a better understanding of metacaspases, which are known to play an important role in trypanosomes and make attractive drug targets due to their absence in humans."
1320,Assembly stoichiometry of bacterial selenocysteine synthase and SelC (tRNAsec).,10.1016/j.febslet.2013.02.014,2013-02-23,[],"In bacteria selenocysteyl-tRNA(sec) (SelC) is synthesized by selenocysteine synthase (SelA). Here we show by fluorescence anisotropy binding assays and electron microscopical symmetry analysis that the SelA-tRNA(sec) binding stoichiometry is of one tRNA(sec) molecule per SelA monomer (1:1) rather than the 1:2 value proposed previously. Negative stain transmission electron microscopy revealed a D5 pointgroup symmetry for the SelA-tRNA(sec) assembly both with and without tRNA(sec) bound. Furthermore, SelA can associate forming a supramolecular complex of stacked decamer rings, which does not occur in the presence of tRNA(sec). We discuss the structure-function relationships of these assemblies and their regulatory role in bacterial selenocysteyl-tRNA(sec) synthesis."
1321,Mathematical modelling of polyamine metabolism in bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei: an application to drug target identification.,10.1371/journal.pone.0053734,2013-02-02,[],"We present the first computational kinetic model of polyamine metabolism in bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis. We systematically extracted the polyamine pathway from the complete metabolic network while still maintaining the predictive capability of the pathway. The kinetic model is constructed on the basis of information gleaned from the experimental biology literature and defined as a set of ordinary differential equations. We applied Michaelis-Menten kinetics featuring regulatory factors to describe enzymatic activities that are well defined. Uncharacterised enzyme kinetics were approximated and justified with available physiological properties of the system. Optimisation-based dynamic simulations were performed to train the model with experimental data and inconsistent predictions prompted an iterative procedure of model refinement. Good agreement between simulation results and measured data reported in various experimental conditions shows that the model has good applicability in spite of there being gaps in the required data. With this kinetic model, the relative importance of the individual pathway enzymes was assessed. We observed that, at low-to-moderate levels of inhibition, enzymes catalysing reactions of de novo AdoMet (MAT) and ornithine production (OrnPt) have more efficient inhibitory effect on total trypanothione content in comparison to other enzymes in the pathway. In our model, prozyme and TSHSyn (the production catalyst of total trypanothione) were also found to exhibit potent control on total trypanothione content but only when they were strongly inhibited. Different chemotherapeutic strategies against T. brucei were investigated using this model and interruption of polyamine synthesis via joint inhibition of MAT or OrnPt together with other polyamine enzymes was identified as an optimal therapeutic strategy."
1322,Characterization of the novel Trypanosoma brucei inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase.,10.1017/S0031182012002090,2013-02-02,[],"There is an alarming rate of human African trypanosomiasis recrudescence in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, the disease has no successful chemotherapy. Trypanosoma lacks the enzymatic machinery for the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides, and is critically dependent on salvage mechanisms. Inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is responsible for the rate-limiting step in guanine nucleotide metabolism. Here, we characterize recombinant Trypanosoma brucei IMPDH (TbIMPDH) to investigate the enzymatic differences between TbIMPDH and host IMPDH. Size-exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity experiments reveal that TbIMPDH forms a heptamer, different from type 1 and 2 mammalian tetrameric IMPDHs. Kinetic analysis reveals calculated K m values of 30 and 1300 μ m for IMP and NAD, respectively. The obtained K m value of TbIMPDH for NAD is approximately 20-200-fold higher than that of mammalian enzymes and indicative of a different NAD binding mode between trypanosomal and mammalian IMPDHs. Inhibition studies show K i values of 3·2 μ m, 21 nM and 3·3 nM for ribavirin 5'-monophosphate, mycophenolic acid and mizoribine 5'-monophosphate, respectively. Our results show that TbIMPDH is different from its mammalian counterpart and thus may be a good target for further studies on anti-trypanosomal drugs."
1323,Crumple: a method for complete enumeration of all possible pseudoknot-free RNA secondary structures.,10.1371/journal.pone.0052414,2013-01-10,[],"The diverse landscape of RNA conformational space includes many canyons and crevices that are distant from the lowest minimum free energy valley and remain unexplored by traditional RNA structure prediction methods. A complete description of the entire RNA folding landscape can facilitate identification of biologically important conformations. The Crumple algorithm rapidly enumerates all possible non-pseudoknotted structures for an RNA sequence without consideration of thermodynamics while filtering the output with experimental data. The Crumple algorithm provides an alternative approach to traditional free energy minimization programs for RNA secondary structure prediction. A complete computation of all non-pseudoknotted secondary structures can reveal structures that would not be predicted by methods that sample the RNA folding landscape based on thermodynamic predictions. The free energy minimization approach is often successful but is limited by not considering RNA tertiary and protein interactions and the possibility that kinetics rather than thermodynamics determines the functional RNA fold. Efficient parallel computing and filters based on experimental data make practical the complete enumeration of all non-pseudoknotted structures. Efficient parallel computing for Crumple is implemented in a ring graph approach. Filters for experimental data include constraints from chemical probing of solvent accessibility, enzymatic cleavage of paired or unpaired nucleotides, phylogenetic covariation, and the minimum number and lengths of helices determined from crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy. The minimum number and length of helices has a significant effect on reducing conformational space. Pairing constraints reduce conformational space more than single nucleotide constraints. Examples with Alfalfa Mosaic Virus RNA and Trypanosome brucei guide RNA demonstrate the importance of evaluating all possible structures when pseduoknots, RNA-protein interactions, and metastable structures are important for biological function.

1324,Trypanosoma brucei S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase N terminus is essential for allosteric activation by the regulatory subunit prozyme.,10.1074/jbc.M112.442475,2013-01-05,[],"Human African trypanosomiasis is caused by a single-celled protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei. Polyamine biosynthesis is a clinically validated target for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis. Metabolic differences between the parasite and the human polyamine pathway are thought to contribute to species selectivity of pathway inhibitors. S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) catalyzes a key step in the production of the polyamine spermidine. We previously showed that trypanosomatid AdoMetDC differs from other eukaryotic enzymes in that it is regulated by heterodimer formation with a catalytically dead paralog, designated prozyme, which binds with high affinity to the enzyme and increases its activity by up to 10(3)-fold. Herein, we examine the role of specific residues involved in AdoMetDC activation by prozyme through deletion and site-directed mutagenesis. Results indicate that 12 key amino acids at the N terminus of AdoMetDC are essential for prozyme-mediated activation with Leu-8, Leu-10, Met-11, and Met-13 identified as the key residues. These N-terminal residues are fully conserved in the trypanosomatids but are absent from other eukaryotic homologs lacking the prozyme mechanism, suggesting co-evolution of these residues with the prozyme mechanism. Heterodimer formation between AdoMetDC and prozyme was not impaired by mutation of Leu-8 and Leu-10 to Ala, suggesting that these residues are involved in a conformational change that is essential for activation. Our findings provide the first insight into the mechanisms that influence catalytic regulation of AdoMetDC and may have potential implications for the development of new inhibitors against this enzyme."

10.1186/1471-2148-4-7",2012-12-25,[],"In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and animals, the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1 functions with Mia40 in the import and oxidative folding of numerous cysteine-rich proteins in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). Erv1 is also required for Fe-S cluster assembly in the cytosol, which uses at least one mitochondrially derived precursor. Here, we characterize an essential Erv1 orthologue from the protist Trypanosoma brucei (TbERV1), which naturally lacks a Mia40 homolog. We report kinetic parameters for physiologically relevant oxidants cytochrome c and O(2), unexpectedly find O(2) and cytochrome c are reduced simultaneously, and demonstrate that efficient reduction of O(2) by TbERV1 is not dependent upon a simple O(2) channel defined by conserved histidine and tyrosine residues. Massive mitochondrial swelling following TbERV1 RNA interference (RNAi) provides evidence that trypanosome Erv1 functions in IMS protein import despite the natural absence of the key player in the yeast and animal import pathways, Mia40. This suggests significant evolutionary divergence from a recently established paradigm in mitochondrial cell biology. Phylogenomic profiling of genes also points to a conserved role for TbERV1 in cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly. Conversely, loss of genes implicated in precursor delivery for cytosolic Fe-S assembly in Entamoeba, Trichomonas, and Giardia suggests fundamental differences in intracellular trafficking pathways for activated iron or sulfur species in anaerobic versus aerobic eukaryotes."

A key component in selectivity involves a specific activation step mediated by a protein homologous with type I nitroreductases, enzymes found predominantly in prokaryotes. Using data from determinations based on flavin cofactor, oxygen-insensitive activity, substrate range, and inhibition profiles, we demonstrate that NTRs from T. cruzi and T. brucei display many characteristics of their bacterial counterparts. Intriguingly, both enzymes preferentially use NADH and quinones as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively, suggesting that they may function as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases in the parasite mitochondrion. We exploited this preference to determine the trypanocidal activity of a library of aziridinyl benzoquinones against bloodstream-form T. brucei. Biochemical screens using recombinant NTR demonstrated that several quinones were effective substrates for the parasite enzyme, having K(cat)/K(m) values 2 orders of magnitude greater than those of nifurtimox and benznidazole. In tests against T. brucei, antiparasitic activity mirrored the biochemical data, with the most potent compounds generally being preferred enzyme substrates. Trypanocidal activity was shown to be NTR dependent, as parasites with elevated levels of this enzyme were hypersensitive to the aziridinyl agent. By unraveling the biochemical characteristics exhibited by the trypanosomal NTRs, we have shown that quinone-based compounds represent a class of trypanocidal compound."
1329,Crystal structures of the Cid1 poly (U) polymerase reveal the mechanism for UTP selectivity.,10.1093/nar/gks740,2012-08-14,[],"Polyuridylation is emerging as a ubiquitous post-translational modification with important roles in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism. These poly (U) tails are added by poly (U) polymerases with homology to poly (A) polymerases; nevertheless, the selection for UTP over ATP remains enigmatic. We report the structures of poly (U) polymerase Cid1 from Schizoscaccharomyces pombe alone and in complex with UTP, CTP, GTP and 3'-dATP. These structures reveal that each of the 4 nt can be accommodated at the active site; however, differences exist that suggest how the polymerase selects UTP over the other nucleotides. Furthermore, we find that Cid1 shares a number of common UTP recognition features with the kinetoplastid terminal uridyltransferases. Kinetic analysis of Cid1's activity for its preferred substrates, UTP and ATP, reveal a clear preference for UTP over ATP. Ultimately, we show that a single histidine in the active site plays a pivotal role for poly (U) activity. Notably, this residue is typically replaced by an asparagine residue in Cid1-family poly (A) polymerases. By mutating this histidine to an asparagine residue in Cid1, we diminished Cid1's activity for UTP addition and improved ATP incorporation, supporting that this residue is important for UTP selectivity."

African trypanosomes are unable to synthesise vitamin B(6) de novo and rely on uptake of B(6) vitamers such as pyridoxal and pyridoxamine from their hosts, which are subsequently phosphorylated by pyridoxal kinase (PdxK). A conditional null mutant of PdxK was generated in Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms showing that this enzyme is essential for growth of the parasite in vitro and for infectivity in mice. Activity of recombinant T. brucei PdxK was comparable to previously published work having a specific activity of 327 ± 13 mU mg(-1) and a K(m)(app) with respect to pyridoxal of 29.6 ± 3.9 µM. A coupled assay was developed demonstrating that the enzyme has equivalent catalytic efficiency with pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, and that ginkgotoxin is an effective pseudo substrate. A high resolution structure of PdxK in complex with ATP revealed important structural differences with the human enzyme. These findings suggest that pyridoxal kinase is an essential and druggable target that could lead to much needed alternative treatments for this devastating disease."
1333,Trypanosoma brucei 20 S editosomes have one RNA substrate-binding site and execute RNA unwinding activity.,10.1074/jbc.M112.365916,2012-06-05,[],"Editing of mitochondrial pre-mRNAs in African trypanosomes generates full-length transcripts by the site-specific insertion and deletion of uridylate nucleotides. The reaction is catalyzed by a 0.8 MDa multienzyme complex, the editosome. Although the binding of substrate pre-edited mRNAs and cognate guide RNAs (gRNAs) represents the first step in the reaction cycle, the biochemical and biophysical details of the editosome/RNA interaction are not understood. Here we show that editosomes bind full-length substrate mRNAs with nanomolar affinity in a nonselective fashion. The complexes do not discriminate-neither kinetically nor thermodynamically-between different mitochondrial pre-mRNAs or between edited and unedited versions of the same transcript. They also bind gRNAs and gRNA/pre-mRNA hybrid RNAs with similar affinities and association rate constants. Gold labeling of editosome-bound RNA in combination with transmission electron microscopy identified a single RNA-binding site per editosome. However, atomic force microscopy of individual pre-mRNA-editosome complexes revealed that multiple editosomes can interact with one pre-mRNA. Lastly, we demonstrate a so far unknown activity of the editing machinery: editosome-bound RNA becomes unfolded by a chaperone-type RNA unwinding activity."
1335,Characterization of the M32 metallocarboxypeptidase of Trypanosoma brucei: differences and similarities with its orthologue in Trypanosoma cruzi.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2012.04.008,2012-05-12,[],"Metallocarboxypeptidases (MCP) of the M32 family of peptidases have been identified in a number of prokaryotic organisms but they are absent from eukaryotic genomes with the remarkable exception of those of trypanosomatids. The genome of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of Sleeping Sickness, encodes one such MCP which displays 72% identity to the characterized TcMCP-1 from Trypanosoma cruzi. As its orthologue, TcMCP-1, Trypanosoma brucei MCP is a cytosolic enzyme expressed in both major stages of the parasite. Purified recombinant TbMCP-1 exhibits a significant hydrolytic activity against the carboxypeptidase B substrate FA (furylacryloil)-Ala-Lys at pH 7.0-7.8 resembling the T. cruzi enzyme. Several divalent cations had little effect on TbMCP-1 activity but increasing amounts of Co(2+) inhibited the enzyme. Despite having similar tertiary structure, both protozoan MCPs display different substrate specificity with respect to P1 position. Thus, TcMCP-1 enzyme cleaved Abz-FVK-(Dnp)-OH substrate (where Abz: o-aminobenzoic acid and Dnp: 2,4-dinitrophenyl) whereas TbMCP-1 had no activity on this substrate. Comparative homology models and sequence alignments using TcMCP-1 as a template led us to map several residues that could explain this difference. To verify this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis was undertaken replacing the TbMCP-1 residues by those present in TcMCP-1. We found that the substitution A414M led TbMCP-1 to gain activity on Abz-FVK-(Dnp)-OH, thus showing that this residue is involved in specificity determination, probably being part of the S1 sub-site. Moreover, the activity of both protozoan MCPs was explored on two vasoactive compounds such as bradykinin and angiotensin I resulting in two different hydrolysis patterns."
1336,Crystal structure of a Trypanosoma brucei metacaspase.,10.1073/pnas.1200885109,2012-04-25,[],"Metacaspases are distantly related caspase-family cysteine peptidases implicated in programmed cell death in plants and lower eukaryotes. They differ significantly from caspases because they are calcium-activated, arginine-specific peptidases that do not require processing or dimerization for activity. To elucidate the basis of these differences and to determine the impact they might have on the control of cell death pathways in lower eukaryotes, the previously undescribed crystal structure of a metacaspase, an inactive mutant of metacaspase 2 (MCA2) from Trypanosoma brucei, has been determined to a resolution of 1.4 Å. The structure comprises a core caspase fold, but with an unusual eight-stranded β-sheet that stabilizes the protein as a monomer. Essential aspartic acid residues, in the predicted S1 binding pocket, delineate the arginine-specific substrate specificity. In addition, MCA2 possesses an unusual N terminus, which encircles the protein and traverses the catalytic dyad, with Y31 acting as a gatekeeper residue. The calcium-binding site is defined by samarium coordinated by four aspartic acid residues, whereas calcium binding itself induces an allosteric conformational change that could stabilize the active site in a fashion analogous to subunit processing in caspases. Collectively, these data give insights into the mechanistic basis of substrate specificity and mode of activation of MCA2 and provide a detailed framework for understanding the role of metacaspases in cell death pathways of lower eukaryotes."

PGAMs are members of two distinct protein families: enzymes that are dependent on or independent of the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate cofactor. We determined the X-ray structure of the monomeric Trypanosoma brucei independent PGAM (TbiPGAM) in its apoenzyme form, and confirmed this observation by small angle X-ray scattering data. Comparing the TbiPGAM structure with the Leishmania mexicana independent PGAM structure, previously reported with a phosphoglycerate molecule bound to the active site, revealed the domain movement resulting from active site occupation. The structure reported here shows the interaction between Asp319 and the metal bound to the active site, and its contribution to the domain movement. Substitution of the metal-binding residue Asp319 by Ala resulted in complete loss of independent PGAM activity, and showed for the first time its involvement in the enzyme's function. As TbiPGAM is an attractive molecular target for drug development, the apoenzyme conformation described here provides opportunities for its use in structure-based drug design approaches.

We have found that four parasites, including T. brucei, contain genes where two or four thymidine kinase (TK) sequences are fused into a single open reading frame. The T. brucei full-length enzyme as well as its two constituent parts, domain 1 and domain 2, were separately expressed and characterized. Of potential interest for nucleoside analog development, T. brucei TK was less discriminative against purines than human TK1 with the following order of catalytic efficiencies: thymidine > deoxyuridine ≫ deoxyinosine > deoxyguanosine. Proteins from the TK1 family are generally dimers or tetramers, and the quaternary structure is linked to substrate affinity. T. brucei TK was primarily monomeric but can be considered a two-domain pseudodimer. Independent kinetic analysis of the two domains showed that only domain 2 was active. It had a similar turnover number (k(cat)) as the full-length enzyme but could not self-dimerize efficiently and had a 5-fold reduced thymidine/deoxyuridine affinity. Domain 1, which lacks three conserved active site residues, can therefore be considered a covalently attached structural partner that enhances substrate binding to domain 2. A consequence of the non-catalytic role of domain 1 is that its active site residues are released from evolutionary pressure, which can be advantageous for developing new catalytic functions. In addition, nearly identical 89-bp sequences present in both domains suggest that the exchange of genetic material between them can further promote evolution."
1339,A fluorescence polarization binding assay to identify inhibitors of flavin-dependent monooxygenases.,10.1016/j.ab.2012.03.002,2012-03-14,[],"N-Hydroxylating monooxygenases (NMOs) are essential for pathogenesis in fungi and bacteria. NMOs catalyze the hydroxylation of sine and ornithine in the biosynthesis of hydroxamate-containing siderophores. Inhibition of kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO), which catalyzes the conversion of kynurenine to 3-hydroxykynurenine, alleviates neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases and brain infections caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. These enzymes are examples of flavin-dependent monooxygenases, which are validated drug targets. Here, we describe the development and optimization of a fluorescence polarization assay to identify potential inhibitors of flavin-dependent monooxygenases. Fluorescently labeled ADP molecules were synthesized and tested. An ADP-TAMRA chromophore bound to KMO with a K(d) value of 0.60 ± 0.05 μM and to the NMOs from Aspergillus fumigatus and Mycobacterium smegmatis with K(d) values of 2.1 ± 0.2 and 4.0 ± 0.2 μM, respectively. The assay was tested in competitive binding experiments with substrates and products of KMO and an NMO. Furthermore, we show that this assay can be used to identify inhibitors of NMOs. A Z' factor of 0.77 was calculated, and we show that the assay exhibits good tolerance to temperature, incubation time, and dimethyl sulfoxide concentration."

Inhibition of trans-splicing results in an accumulation of partially processed oligocistronic mRNAs. Here, we show that the accumulation of newly synthesised partially processed mRNAs results in the formation of foci around the periphery of the nucleus. These nuclear periphery granules (NPGs) contain the full complement of P-body proteins identified in trypanosomes to date, as well as poly(A)-binding protein 2 and the trypanosome homologue of the RNA helicase VASA. NPGs resemble perinuclear germ granules from metazoa more than P-bodies because they: (1) are localised around the nuclear periphery; (2) are dependent on active transcription; (3) are not dissipated by cycloheximide; (4) contain VASA; and (5) depend on nuclear integrity. In addition, NPGs can be induced in cells depleted of the P-body core component SCD6. The description of NPGs in trypanosomes provides evidence that there is a perinuclear compartment that can determine the fate of newly transcribed mRNAs and that germ granules could be a specialised derivative."
1342,Biological and structural characterization of Trypanosoma cruzi phosphodiesterase C and Implications for design of parasite selective inhibitors.,10.1074/jbc.M111.326777,2012-02-24,[],"Trypanosoma cruzi phosphodiesterase C (TcrPDEC) is a potential new drug target for the treatment of Chagas disease but has not been well studied. This study reports the enzymatic properties of various kinetoplastid PDECs and the crystal structures of the unliganded TcrPDEC1 catalytic domain and its complex with an inhibitor. Mutations of PDEC during the course of evolution led to inactivation of PDEC in Trypanosoma brucei/Trypanosoma evansi/Trypanosoma congolense, whereas the enzyme is active in all other kinetoplastids. The TcrPDEC1 catalytic domain hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP with a K(m) of 23.8 μm and a k(cat) of 31 s(-1) for cAMP and a K(m) of 99.1 μm and a k(cat) of 17 s(-1) for cGMP, thus confirming its dual specificity. The crystal structures show that the N-terminal fragment wraps around the TcrPDEC catalytic domain and may thus regulate its enzymatic activity via direct interactions with the active site residues. A PDE5 selective inhibitor that has an IC(50) of 230 nm for TcrPDEC1 binds to TcrPDEC1 in an orientation opposite to that of sildenafil. This observation, together with the screen of the inhibitory potency of human PDE inhibitors against TcrPDEC, implies that the scaffold of some human PDE inhibitors might be used as the starting model for design of parasite PDE inhibitors. The structural study also identified a unique parasite pocket that neighbors the active site and may thus be valuable for the design of parasite-specific inhibitors."

Despite this interest of S. glossinidius as a paratransgenic platform organism in tsetse flies, few potential effector molecules have been identified so far and to date none of these molecules have been successfully expressed in this bacterium.
In this study, S. glossinidius was transformed to express a single domain antibody, (Nanobody®) Nb_An33, that efficiently targets conserved cryptic epitopes of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Next, we analyzed the capability of two predicted secretion signals to direct the extracellular delivery of significant levels of active Nb_An33. We show that the pelB leader peptide was successful in directing the export of fully functional Nb_An33 to the periplasm of S. glossinidius resulting in significant levels of extracellular release. Finally, S. glossinidius expressing pelBNb_An33 exhibited no significant reduction in terms of fitness, determined by in vitro growth kinetics, compared to the wild-type strain.
These data are the first demonstration of the expression and extracellular release of functional trypanosome-interfering Nanobodies® in S. glossinidius. Furthermore, Sodalis strains that efficiently released the effector protein were not affected in their growth, suggesting that they may be competitive with endogenous microbiota in the midgut environment of the tsetse fly. Collectively, these data reinforce the notion for the potential of S. glossinidius to be developed into a paratransgenic platform organism."
1344,High throughput screening against the peroxidase cascade of African trypanosomes identifies antiparasitic compounds that inactivate tryparedoxin.,10.1074/jbc.M111.338285,2012-01-26,[],"In African trypanosomes, the detoxification of broad spectrum hydroperoxides relies on a unique cascade composed of trypanothione (T(SH)(2)), trypanothione reductase, tryparedoxin (Tpx), and nonselenium glutathione peroxidase-type enzymes. All three proteins are essential for Trypanosoma brucei. Here, we subjected the complete system to a high throughput screening approach with nearly 80,000 chemicals. Twelve compounds inhibited the peroxidase system. All but one carried chloroalkyl substituents. The detailed kinetic analysis showed that two compounds weakly inhibited trypanothione reductase, but none of them specifically interacted with the peroxidase. They proved to be time-dependent inhibitors of Tpx-modifying Cys-40, the first cysteine of its active site WCPPC motif. Importantly, gel shift assays verified Tpx as a target in the intact parasites. T(SH)(2), present in the in vitro assays and in the cells in high molar excess, did not interfere with Tpx inactivation. The compounds inhibited the proliferation of bloodstream T. brucei with EC(50) values down to <1 μM and exerted up to 83-fold lower toxicity toward HeLa cells. Irreversible inhibitors are traditionally regarded as unfavorable. However, a large number of antimicrobials and anticancer therapeutics acts covalently with their target protein. The compounds identified here also interacted with recombinant human thioredoxin, a distant relative of Tpx. This finding might even be exploited for thioredoxin-based anticancer drug development approaches reported recently. The fact that the T(SH)(2)/Tpx couple occupies a central position within the trypanosomal thiol metabolism and delivers electrons also for the synthesis of DNA precursors renders the parasite-specific oxidoreductase an attractive drug target molecule."
1345,Substrate inhibition and allosteric regulation by heparan sulfate of Trypanosoma brucei cathepsin L.,10.1016/j.bbapap.2011.12.006,2012-01-12,[],"The cysteine protease brucipain is an important drug target in the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of both Human African trypanosomiasis and Animal African trypanosomiasis. Brucipain is closely related to mammalian cathepsin L and currently used as a framework for the development of inhibitors that display anti-parasitic activity. We show that recombinant brucipain lacking the C-terminal extension undergoes inhibition by the substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-FR-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin at concentrations above the K(m), but not by benzyloxycarbonyl-VLR-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. The allosteric modulation exerted by the substrate is controlled by temperature, being apparent at 25°C but concealed at 37°C. The behavior of the enzyme in vitro can be explained by discrete conformational changes caused by the shifts in temperature that render it less susceptible to substrate inhibition. Enzyme inhibition by the di-peptydyl substrate impaired the degradation of human fibrinogen at 25°C, but not at 37°C. We also found that heparan sulfate acts as a natural allosteric modulator of the enzyme through interactions that prevent substrate inhibition. We propose that brucipain shifts between an active and an inactive form as a result of temperature-dependent allosteric regulation."
1346,Flavin-linked Erv-family sulfhydryl oxidases release superoxide anion during catalytic turnover.,10.1021/bi201672h,2011-12-14,[],"Typically, simple flavoprotein oxidases couple the oxidation of their substrates with the formation of hydrogen peroxide without release of significant levels of the superoxide ion. However, two evolutionarily related single-domain sulfhydryl oxidases (Erv2p; a yeast endoplasmic reticulum resident protein and augmenter of liver regeneration, ALR, an enzyme predominantly found in the mitochondrial intermembrane) release up to ~30% of the oxygen they reduce as the superoxide ion. Both enzymes oxidize dithiol substrates via a redox-active disulfide adjacent to the flavin cofactor within the helix-rich Erv domain. Subsequent reduction of the flavin is followed by transfer of reducing equivalents to molecular oxygen. Superoxide release was initially detected using tris(3-hydroxypropyl)phosphine (THP) as an alternative reducing substrate to dithiothreitol (DTT). THP, and other phosphines, showed anomalously high turnover numbers with Erv2p and ALR in the oxygen electrode, but oxygen consumption was drastically suppressed upon the addition of superoxide dismutase. The superoxide ion initiates a radical chain reaction promoting the aerobic oxidation of phosphines with the formation of hydrogen peroxide. Use of a known flux of superoxide generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system showed that one superoxide ion stimulates the reduction of 27 and 4.5 molecules of oxygen using THP and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), respectively. This superoxide-dependent amplification of oxygen consumption by phosphines provides a new kinetic method for the detection of superoxide. Superoxide release was also observed by a standard chemiluminescence method using a luciferin analogue (MCLA) when 2 mM DTT was employed as a substrate of Erv2p and ALR. The percentage of superoxide released from Erv2p increased to ~65% when monomeric mutants of the normally homodimeric enzyme were used. In contrast, monomeric multidomain quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase enzymes that also contain an Erv FAD-binding fold release only 1-5% of their total reduced oxygen species as the superoxide ion. Aspects of the mechanism and possible physiological significance of superoxide release from these Erv-domain flavoproteins are discussed."
1347,Determinants of the differential antizyme-binding affinity of ornithine decarboxylase.,"10.1371/journal.pone.0026835
10.1371/journal.pone.0019253",2011-11-11,[],"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a ubiquitous enzyme that is conserved in all species from bacteria to humans. Mammalian ODC is degraded by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent manner by direct binding to the antizyme (AZ). In contrast, Trypanosoma brucei ODC has a low binding affinity toward AZ. In this study, we identified key amino acid residues that govern the differential AZ binding affinity of human and Trypanosoma brucei ODC. Multiple sequence alignments of the ODC putative AZ-binding site highlights several key amino acid residues that are different between the human and Trypanosoma brucei ODC protein sequences, including residue 119, 124,125, 129, 136, 137 and 140 (the numbers is for human ODC). We generated a septuple human ODC mutant protein where these seven bases were mutated to match the Trypanosoma brucei ODC protein sequence. The septuple mutant protein was much less sensitive to AZ inhibition compared to the WT protein, suggesting that these amino acid residues play a role in human ODC-AZ binding. Additional experiments with sextuple mutants suggest that residue 137 plays a direct role in AZ binding, and residues 119 and 140 play secondary roles in AZ binding. The dissociation constants were also calculated to quantify the affinity of the ODC-AZ binding interaction. The K(d) value for the wild type ODC protein-AZ heterodimer ([ODC_WT]-AZ) is approximately 0.22 μM, while the K(d) value for the septuple mutant-AZ heterodimer ([ODC_7M]-AZ) is approximately 12.4 μM. The greater than 50-fold increase in [ODC_7M]-AZ binding affinity shows that the ODC-7M enzyme has a much lower binding affinity toward AZ. For the mutant proteins ODC_7M(-Q119H) and ODC_7M(-V137D), the K(d) was 1.4 and 1.2 μM, respectively. These affinities are 6-fold higher than the WT_ODC K(d), which suggests that residues 119 and 137 play a role in AZ binding."
1348,Activation of benznidazole by trypanosomal type I nitroreductases results in glyoxal formation.,10.1128/AAC.05135-11,2011-11-01,[],"Benznidazole, a 2-nitroimidazole, is the front-line treatment used against American trypanosomiasis, a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Despite nearly 40 years of use, the trypanocidal activity of this prodrug is not fully understood. It has been proposed that benznidazole activation leads to the formation of reductive metabolites that can cause a series of deleterious effects, including DNA damage and thiol depletion. Here, we show that the key step in benznidazole activation involves an NADH-dependent trypanosomal type I nitroreductase. This catalyzes an oxygen-insensitive reaction with the interaction of enzyme, reductant, and prodrug occurring through a ping-pong mechanism. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis of the resultant metabolites identified 4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxyimidazole as the major product of a reductive pathway proceeding through hydroxylamine and hydroxy intermediates. The breakdown of this product released the reactive dialdehyde glyoxal, which, in the presence of guanosine, generated guanosine-glyoxal adducts. These experiments indicate that the reduction of benznidazole by type I nitroreductase activity leads to the formation of highly reactive metabolites and that the expression of this enzyme is key to the trypanocidal properties displayed by the prodrug."
1349,Effect of substrate features and mutagenesis of active site tyrosine residues on the reaction course catalysed by Trypanosoma brucei sterol C-24-methyltransferase.,10.1042/BJ20110865,2011-07-09,[],"TbSMT [Trypanosoma brucei 24-SMT (sterol C-24-methyltransferase)] synthesizes an unconventional 24-alkyl sterol product set consisting of Δ24(25)-, Δ24(28)- and Δ25(27)-olefins. The C-methylation reaction requires Si(β)-face C-24-methyl addition coupled to reversible migration of positive charge from C-24 to C-25. The hydride shifts responsible for charge migration in formation of multiple ergostane olefin isomers catalysed by TbSMT were examined by incubation of a series of sterol acceptors paired with AdoMet (S-adenosyl-L-methionine). Results obtained with zymosterol compared with the corresponding 24-2H and 27-13C derivatives revealed isotopic-sensitive branching in the hydride transfer reaction on the path to form a 24-methyl-Δ24(25)-olefin product (kinetic isotope effect, kH/kD=1.20), and stereospecific CH3→CH2 elimination at the C28 branch and C27 cis-terminal methyl to form Δ24(28) and Δ25(27) products respectively. Cholesta-5,7,22,24-tetraenol converted into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraenol and 24β-hydroxy ergosta-5,7,23-trienol (new compound), whereas ergosta-5,24-dienol converted into 24-dimethyl ergosta-5,25(27)-dienol and cholesta-5,7,24-trienol converted into ergosta-5,7,25(27)trienol, ergosta-5,7,24(28)-trienol, ergosta-5,7,24-trienol and 24 dimethyl ergosta-5,7,25(27)-trienol. We made use of our prior research and molecular modelling of 24-SMT to identify contact amino acids that might affect catalysis. Conserved tyrosine residues at positions 66, 177 and 208 in TbSMT were replaced with phenylalanine residues. The substitutions generated variable loss of activity during the course of the first C-1-transfer reaction, which differs from the corresponding Erg6p mutants that afforded a gain in C-2-transfer activity. The results show that differences exist among 24-SMTs in control of C-1- and C-2-transfer activities by interactions of intermediate and aromatic residues in the activated complex and provide an opportunity for rational drug design of a parasite enzyme not synthesized by the human host."
1350,Langevin dynamics deciphers the motility pattern of swimming parasites.,10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.208103,2011-06-15,[],The parasite African trypanosome swims in the bloodstream of mammals and causes the highly dangerous human sleeping sickness. Cell motility is essential for the parasite's survival within the mammalian host. We present an analysis of the random-walk pattern of a swimming trypanosome. From experimental time-autocorrelation functions for the direction of motion we identify two relaxation times that differ by an order of magnitude. They originate from the rapid deformations of the cell body and a slower rotational diffusion of the average swimming direction. Velocity fluctuations are athermal and increase for faster cells whose trajectories are also straighter. We demonstrate that such a complex dynamics is captured by two decoupled Langevin equations that decipher the complex trajectory pattern by referring it to the microscopic details of cell behavior.
1351,A tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidase protects African trypanosomes from membrane damage.,10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.05.014,2011-06-07,[],"Hydroperoxide detoxification in African trypanosomes is achieved by 2-Cys-peroxiredoxin (TXNPx)- and non-selenium glutathione peroxidase (Px)-type enzymes which both obtain their reducing equivalents from the unique trypanothione/tryparedoxin system. Previous RNA interference approaches revealed that the cytosolic TXNPx and the Px-type enzymes are essential for Trypanosoma brucei. Because of partially overlapping in vitro substrate specificities and subcellular localisation the physiological function of the individual enzymes was not yet clear. As shown here, TXNPx and Px are expressed at comparable levels and in their active reduced state. Px-overexpressing parasites were less sensitive toward linoleic acid hydroperoxide but not hydrogen peroxide. Kinetic studies confirmed that Px-but not TXNPx-reduces lipophilic hydroperoxides including phospholipids with high efficiency. Most interestingly, the severe proliferation defect of Px-depleted bloodstream cells could be rescued by Trolox, but not by hydrophilic antioxidants, in the medium. This allowed us to knock-out the three Px genes individually and thus to distinguish their in vivo role. Deletion of the cytosolic Px I and II resulted in extremely fast membrane peroxidation followed by cell lysis. Cells lacking specifically the mitochondrial Px III showed a transient growth retardation and cardiolipin peroxidation but adapted within 24h to normal proliferation."
1352,The C-terminal end of the Trypanosoma brucei editing deaminase plays a critical role in tRNA binding.,10.1261/rna.2748211,2011-05-24,[],"Adenosine to inosine editing at the wobble position allows decoding of multiple codons by a single tRNA. This reaction is catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on tRNA (ADATs) and is essential for viability. In bacteria, the anticodon-specific enzyme is a homodimer that recognizes a single tRNA substrate (tRNA(Arg)(ACG)) and can efficiently deaminate short anticodon stem-loop mimics of this tRNA in vitro. The eukaryal enzyme is composed of two nonidentical subunits, ADAT2 and ADAT3, which upon heterodimerization, recognize seven to eight different tRNAs as substrates, depending on the organism, and require a full-length tRNA for activity. Although crystallographic data have provided clues to why the bacterial deaminase can utilize short substrates, residues that provide substrate binding and recognition with the eukaryotic enzymes are not currently known. In the present study, we have used a combination of mutagenesis, binding studies, and kinetic analysis to explore the contribution of individual residues in Trypanosoma brucei ADAT2 (TbADAT2) to tRNA recognition. We show that deletion of the last 10 amino acids at the C terminus of TbADAT2 abolishes tRNA binding. In addition, single alanine replacements of a string of positively charged amino acids (KRKRK) lead to binding defects that correlate with losses in enzyme activity. This region, which we have termed the KR-domain, provides a first glance at key residues involved in tRNA binding by eukaryotic tRNA editing deaminases."
1353,Transketolase in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2011.04.006,2011-05-17,[],"A single copy gene, encoding a protein highly similar to transketolase from other systems, was identified in the Trypanosoma brucei genome. The gene was expressed in E. coli and the purified protein demonstrated transketolase activity with K(m) values of 0.2mM and 0.8mM respectively for xylulose 5-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate. A peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS-1) present at the C-terminus of the protein suggested a glycosomal localisation. However, subcellular localisation experiments revealed that while the protein was present in glycosomes it was found mainly within the cytosol and thus has a dual localisation. Transketolase activity was absent from the long slender bloodstream form of the parasite and the protein was not detectable in this life cycle stage, with the RNA present only at low abundance, indicating a strong differential regulation, being present predominantly in the procyclic form. The gene was knocked out from procyclic T. brucei and transketolase activity was lost but no growth phenotype was evident in the null mutants. Metabolite profiling to compare wild type and TKT null mutants revealed substantial increases in transketolase substrate metabolites coupled to loss of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, a principal product of the transketolase reaction."
1355,A single zinc ion is sufficient for an active Trypanosoma brucei tRNA editing deaminase.,10.1074/jbc.M111.243568,2011-04-22,[],"Editing of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) at the first anticodon position in tRNA is catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on tRNA (ADATs). This essential reaction in bacteria and eukarya permits a single tRNA to decode multiple codons. Bacterial ADATa is a homodimer with two bound essential Zn(2+). The ADATa crystal structure revealed residues important for substrate binding and catalysis; however, such high resolution structural information is not available for eukaryotic tRNA deaminases. Despite significant sequence similarity among deaminases, we continue to uncover unexpected functional differences between Trypanosoma brucei ADAT2/3 (TbADAT2/3) and its bacterial counterpart. Previously, we demonstrated that TbADAT2/3 is unique in catalyzing two different deamination reactions. Here we show by kinetic analyses and inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry that wild type TbADAT2/3 coordinates two Zn(2+) per heterodimer, but unlike any other tRNA deaminase, mutation of one of the key Zn(2+)-coordinating cysteines in TbADAT2 yields a functional enzyme with a single-bound zinc. These data suggest that, at least, TbADAT3 may play a role in catalysis via direct coordination of the catalytic Zn(2+). These observations raise the possibility of an unusual Zn(2+) coordination interface with important implications for the function and evolution of editing deaminases."
1356,"Trypanocidal furamidine analogues: influence of pyridine nitrogens on trypanocidal activity, transport kinetics, and resistance patterns.",10.1128/AAC.01551-10,2011-03-16,[],"Current therapies for human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) are unsatisfactory and under threat from emerging drug resistance linked to the loss of transporters, e.g., the P2 aminopurine transporter (TbAT1). Here we compare the uptake and trypanocidal properties of furamidine (DB75), recently evaluated in clinical trials against stage 1 (haemolymphatic) HAT, and two aza analogues, DB820 and CPD0801 (DB829), which are candidate compounds for treatment of stage 2 (neurological) disease. Values of 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) determined in vitro against both wild-type and transporter mutant parasites were submicromolar, with DB75 trypanotoxicity shown to be better than and DB820 trypanotoxicity similar to that of the widely used veterinary trypanocide diminazene, while CPD0801 was less active. Activity correlated with uptake and with the minimum drug exposure time necessary to kill trypanosomes: DB75 accumulated at double and 10-fold the rates of DB820 and CPD0801, respectively. All three compounds inhibited P2-mediated adenosine transport with similar Ki values, indicating affinity values for this permease in the low to submicromolar range. Uptake of DB75, DB820, and CPD0801 was significantly reduced in tbat1-/- parasites and was sensitive to inhibition by adenine, showing that all three compounds are substrates for the P2 transporter. Uptake in vitro was significantly less than that seen with parasites freshly isolated from infected rats, correlating with a downregulation of P2 activity in vitro. We conclude that DB75, DB820, and CPD0801 are actively accumulated by Trypanosoma brucei brucei, with P2 as the main transport route. The aza analogues of DB75 accumulate more slowly than furamidine itself and reveal less trypanocidal activity in standard in vitro drug sensitivity assays."
1357,Functional characterization of NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase isozymes from Trypanosoma cruzi.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2011.01.010,2011-02-05,[],"Trypanosoma cruzi exhibits two putative isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs). Both idh genes were cloned and the recombinant enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli. Our results showed that T. cruzi IDHs are strictly dependent on NADP(+) and display apparent affinities towards isocitrate and the coenzyme in the low micromolar range. In T. cruzi, IDHs are cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes, and there is no evidence for the typical Krebs cycle-related NAD-dependent IDH. Hence, like in Trypanosoma brucei, the Krebs cycle is not a canonical route in T. cruzi. However, the citrate produced in the mitochondrion could be isomerized into isocitrate in the cytosol and the mitochondrion by means of the putative aconitase, which would provide the substrate for both IDHs. The cytosolic IDH is significantly more abundant in amastigotes, cell-derived and metacyclic trypomastigotes than in epimastigotes. This observation fits in well with the expected oxidative burst this pathogen has to face when infecting the mammalian host."

This series was initially discovered by a virtual screening campaign (J. Med. Chem., 2009, 52, 4454). The inhibitors adopted an alternative binding mode to those of the natural ligands, biopterin and dihydrobiopterin, and classical inhibitors, such as methotrexate. Using both rational medicinal chemistry and structure-based approaches, we were able to derive compounds with potent activity against T. brucei PTR1 (K(i)(app)=7 nM), which had high selectivity over both human and T. brucei dihydrofolate reductase. Unfortunately, these compounds displayed weak activity against the parasites. Kinetic studies and analysis indicate that the main reason for the lack of cell potency is due to the compounds having insufficient potency against the enzyme, which can be seen from the low K(m) to K(i) ratio (K(m)=25 nM and K(i)=2.3 nM, respectively)."
1359,Dissecting the metabolic roles of pteridine reductase 1 in Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major.,10.1074/jbc.M110.209593,2011-01-18,[],"Leishmania parasites are pteridine auxotrophs that use an NADPH-dependent pteridine reductase 1 (PTR1) and NADH-dependent quinonoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR) to salvage and maintain intracellular pools of tetrahydrobiopterin (H(4)B). However, the African trypanosome lacks a credible candidate QDPR in its genome despite maintaining apparent QDPR activity. Here we provide evidence that the NADH-dependent activity previously reported by others is an assay artifact. Using an HPLC-based enzyme assay, we demonstrate that there is an NADPH-dependent QDPR activity associated with both TbPTR1 and LmPTR1. The kinetic properties of recombinant PTR1s are reported at physiological pH and ionic strength and compared with LmQDPR. Specificity constants (k(cat)/K(m)) for LmPTR1 are similar with dihydrobiopterin (H(2)B) and quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qH(2)B) as substrates and about 20-fold lower than LmQDPR with qH(2)B. In contrast, TbPTR1 shows a 10-fold higher k(cat)/K(m) for H(2)B over qH(2)B. Analysis of Trypanosoma brucei isolated from infected rats revealed that H(4)B (430 nM, 98% of total biopterin) was the predominant intracellular pterin, consistent with a dual role in the salvage and regeneration of H(4)B. Gene knock-out experiments confirmed this: PTR1-nulls could only be obtained from lines overexpressing LmQDPR with H(4)B as a medium supplement. These cells grew normally with H(4)B, which spontaneously oxidizes to qH(2)B, but were unable to survive in the absence of pterin or with either biopterin or H(2)B in the medium. These findings establish that PTR1 has an essential and dual role in pterin metabolism in African trypanosomes and underline its potential as a drug target."
1360,Structure determination of glycogen synthase kinase-3 from Leishmania major and comparative inhibitor structure-activity relationships with Trypanosoma brucei GSK-3.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2010.12.009,2011-01-05,[],"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a drug target under intense investigation in pharmaceutical companies and constitutes an attractive piggyback target for eukaryotic pathogens. Two different GSKs are found in trypanosomatids, one about 150 residues shorter than the other. GSK-3 short (GeneDB: Tb927.10.13780) has previously been validated genetically as a drug target in Trypanosoma brucei by RNAi induced growth retardation; and chemically by correlation between enzyme and in vitro growth inhibition. Here, we report investigation of the equivalent GSK-3 short enzymes of L. major (LmjF18.0270) and L. infantum (LinJ18_V3.0270, identical in amino acid sequences to LdonGSK-3 short) and a crystal structure of LmajGSK-3 short at 2 Å resolution. The inhibitor structure-activity relationships (SARs) of L. major and L. infantum are virtually identical, suggesting that inhibitors could be useful for both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmania spp. GSK-3 short has different inhibitor SARs than TbruGSK-3 short, which can be explained mostly by two variant residues in the ATP-binding pocket. Indeed, mutating these residues in the ATP-binding site of LmajGSK-3 short to the TbruGSK-3 short equivalents results in a mutant LmajGSK-3 short enzyme with SAR more similar to that of TbruGSK-3 short. The differences between human GSK-3β (HsGSK-3β) and LmajGSK-3 short SAR suggest that compounds which selectively inhibit LmajGSK-3 short may be found."
1362,Tryparedoxin peroxidases from Trypanosoma cruzi: high efficiency in the catalytic elimination of hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite.,10.1016/j.abb.2010.12.014,2010-12-21,[],"During host cell infection, Trypanosoma cruzi parasites are exposed to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. As part of their antioxidant defense systems, they express two tryparedoxin peroxidases (TXNPx), thiol-dependent peroxidases members of the peroxiredoxin family. In this work, we report a kinetic characterization of cytosolic (c-TXNPx) and mitochondrial (m-TXNPx) tryparedoxin peroxidases from T. cruzi. Both c-TXNPx and m-TXNPx rapidly reduced hydrogen peroxide (k=3.0 x 10⁷ and 6 x 10⁶ M⁻¹ s⁻¹ at pH 7.4 and 25 °C, respectively) and peroxynitrite (k=1.0 x 10⁶ and k=1.8 x 10⁷ M⁻¹ s⁻¹ at pH 7.4 and 25 °C, respectively). The reductive part of the catalytic cycle was also studied, and the rate constant for the reduction of c-TXNPx by tryparedoxin I was 1.3 x 10⁶ M⁻¹ s⁻¹. The catalytic role of two conserved cysteine residues in both TXNPxs was confirmed with the identification of Cys52 and Cys173 (in c-TXNPX) and Cys81 and Cys204 (in m-TXNPx) as the peroxidatic and resolving cysteines, respectively. Our results indicate that mitochondrial and cytosolic TXNPxs from T. cruzi are highly efficient peroxidases that reduce hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite, and contribute to the understanding of their role as virulence factors reported in vivo."
1363,The 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase of Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana: gene characterization and protein structure prediction.,10.1159/000320697,2010-12-17,[],"6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) is a key enzyme of the oxidative branch involved in the generation of NADPH and ribulose 5-phosphate. In the present work, we describe the cloning, sequencing and characterization of a 6PGDH gene from Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana. The gene encodes a polypeptide chain of 479 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 52 kDa and a pI of 5.77. The recombinant protein possesses a dimeric quaternary structure and displays kinetic parameter values intermediate between those reported for Trypanosoma brucei and T. cruzi with apparent K(m) values of 6.93 and 5.2 μM for 6PG and NADP(+), respectively. The three-dimensional structure of the enzymes of Leishmania and T. cruzi were modelled from their amino acid sequence using the crystal structure of the enzyme of T. brucei as template. The amino acid residues located in the 6PGDH C-terminal region, which are known to participate in the salt bridges maintaining the protein dimeric structure, differed significantly among the enzymes of Leishmania, T. cruzi, and T. brucei. Our results strongly suggest that 6PGDH can be selected as a potential target for the development of new therapeutic drugs in order to improve existing chemotherapeutic treatments against these parasites."
1365,Highly specific methyl-end fatty-acid desaturases of trypanosomatids.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2010.10.006,2010-10-27,[],"A detailed analysis of the trypanosomatids' genome projects revealed the presence of genes predicted to encode fatty-acid desaturases of the methyl-end type (MED). After cloning and functional characterization of all identified genes, it can be concluded that Trypanosoma cruzi contains two MEDs with oleate desaturase (OD) activities whereas Leishmania major contains one OD and two active linoleate desaturases (LD). All characterized ODs are highly specific for oleate (18:1Δ9) as substrate, presenting a ν+3 regioselectivity, although palmitoleate (16:1Δ9) can be desaturated as well, but to a lesser extent. L. major LD appears to use exclusively linoleate (18:2n-6), converting it into α-linolenate (18:3n-3). This strong specificity assures no further conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the n-6 series into the n-3 series, downstream in the PUFA biosynthesis pathway. This characterization completes the identification of all enzymes involved in PUFA biosynthesis in a parasitic protist. Differently from their Trypanosoma brucei orthologue, T. cruzi and L. major ODs were more active when expressed either, in the presence of trienoic fatty acids or at higher temperatures. This could be evidence for a differential post-translational regulation of these enzymes as a result of direct sensing of environmentally dependent parameters such as membrane fluidity."
1367,2-Hexadecynoic acid inhibits plasmodial FAS-II enzymes and arrests erythrocytic and liver stage Plasmodium infections.,10.1016/j.bmc.2010.08.055,2010-09-22,[],"Acetylenic fatty acids are known to display several biological activities, but their antimalarial activity has remained unexplored. In this study, we synthesized the 2-, 5-, 6-, and 9-hexadecynoic acids (HDAs) and evaluated their in vitro activity against erythrocytic (blood) stages of Plasmodium falciparum and liver stages of Plasmodium yoelii infections. Since the type II fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (PfFAS-II) has recently been shown to be indispensable for liver stage malaria parasites, the inhibitory potential of the HDAs against multiple P. falciparum FAS-II (PfFAS-II) elongation enzymes was also evaluated. The highest antiplasmodial activity against blood stages of P. falciparum was displayed by 5-HDA (IC(50) value 6.6 μg/ml), whereas the 2-HDA was the only acid arresting the growth of liver stage P. yoelii infection, in both flow cytometric assay (IC(50) value 2-HDA 15.3 μg/ml, control drug atovaquone 2.5 ng/ml) and immunofluorescence analysis (IC(50) 2-HDA 4.88 μg/ml, control drug atovaquone 0.37 ng/ml). 2-HDA showed the best inhibitory activity against the PfFAS-II enzymes PfFabI and PfFabZ with IC(50) values of 0.38 and 0.58 μg/ml (IC(50) control drugs 14 and 30 ng/ml), respectively. Enzyme kinetics and molecular modeling studies revealed valuable insights into the binding mechanism of 2-HDA on the target enzymes. All HDAs showed in vitro activity against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (IC(50) values 3.7-31.7 μg/ml), Trypanosoma cruzi (only 2-HDA, IC(50) 20.2 μg/ml), and Leishmania donovani (IC(50) values 4.1-13.4 μg/ml) with generally low or no significant toxicity on mammalian cells. This is the first study to indicate therapeutic potential of HDAs against various parasitic protozoa. It also points out that the malarial liver stage growth inhibitory effect of the 2-HDA may be promoted via PfFAS-II enzymes. The lack of cytotoxicity, lipophilic nature, and calculated pharmacokinetic properties suggests that 2-HDA could be a useful compound to study the interaction of fatty acids with these key P. falciparum enzymes."
1368,Structure and mechanism of the 6-oxopurine nucleosidase from Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1021/bi100697d,2010-09-10,[],"Trypanosomes are purine-auxotrophic parasites that depend upon nucleoside hydrolase (NH) activity to salvage nitrogenous bases necessary for nucleic acid and cofactor synthesis. Nonspecific and purine-specific NHs have been widely studied, yet little is known about the 6-oxopurine-specific isozymes, although they are thought to play a primary role in the catabolism of exogenously derived nucleosides. Here, we report the first functional and structural characterization of the inosine-guanosine-specific NH from Trypanosoma brucei brucei. The enzyme shows near diffusion-limited efficiency coupled with a clear specificity for 6-oxopurine nucleosides achieved through a catalytic selection of these substrates. Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis reveals ordered product release, and a rate-limiting structural rearrangement that is associated with the release of the product, ribose. The crystal structure of this trypanosomal NH determined to 2.5 Å resolution reveals distinctive features compared to those of both purine- and pyrimidine-specific isozymes in the framework of the conserved and versatile NH fold. Nanomolar iminoribitol-based inhibitors identified in this study represent important lead compounds for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against trypanosomal diseases."
1369,Regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases: the human protein kinase X (PrKX) reveals the role of the catalytic subunit alphaH-alphaI loop.,10.1074/jbc.M110.155150,2010-09-08,[],"cAMP-dependent protein kinases are reversibly complexed with any of the four isoforms of regulatory (R) subunits, which contain either a substrate or a pseudosubstrate autoinhibitory domain. The human protein kinase X (PrKX) is an exemption as it is inhibited only by pseudosubstrate inhibitors, i.e. RIα or RIβ but not by substrate inhibitors RIIα or RIIβ. Detailed examination of the capacity of five PrKX-like kinases ranging from human to protozoa (Trypanosoma brucei) to form holoenzymes with human R subunits in living cells shows that this preference for pseudosubstrate inhibitors is evolutionarily conserved. To elucidate the molecular basis of this inhibitory pattern, we applied bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and surface plasmon resonance in combination with site-directed mutagenesis. We observed that the conserved αH-αI loop residue Arg-283 in PrKX is crucial for its RI over RII preference, as a R283L mutant was able to form a holoenzyme complex with wild type RII subunits. Changing the corresponding αH-αI loop residue in PKA Cα (L277R), significantly destabilized holoenzyme complexes in vitro, as cAMP-mediated holoenzyme activation was facilitated by a factor of 2-4, and lead to a decreased affinity of the mutant C subunit for R subunits, significantly affecting RII containing holoenzymes."
1370,The impact of mRNA structure on guide RNA targeting in kinetoplastid RNA editing.,10.1371/journal.pone.0012235,2010-09-03,[],"Mitochondrial mRNA editing in Trypanosoma brucei requires the specific interaction of a guide RNA with its cognate mRNA. Hundreds of gRNAs are involved in the editing process, each needing to target their specific editing domain within the target message. We hypothesized that the structure surrounding the mRNA target may be a limiting factor and involved in the regulation process. In this study, we selected four mRNAs with distinct target structures and investigated how sequence and structure affected efficient gRNA targeting. Two of the mRNAs, including the ATPase subunit 6 and ND7-550 (5' end of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 7) that have open, accessible anchor binding sites show very efficient gRNA targeting. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that the cognate gRNA for ND7-550 had 10-fold higher affinity for its mRNA than the A6 pair. Surface plasmon resonance studies indicate that the difference in affinity was due to a four-fold faster association rate. As expected, mRNAs with considerable structure surrounding the anchor binding sites were less accessible and had very low affinity for their cognate gRNAs. In vitro editing assays indicate that efficient pairing is crucial for gRNA directed cleavage. However, only the A6 substrate showed gRNA-directed cleavage at the correct editing site. This suggests that different gRNA/mRNA pairs may require different ""sets"" of accessory factors for efficient editing. By characterizing a number of different gRNA/mRNA interactions, we may be able to define a ""bank"" of RNA editing substrates with different putative chaperone and other co-factor requirements. This will allow the more efficient identification and characterization of transcript specific RNA editing accessory proteins."
1371,α-ketoheterocycles as inhibitors of Leishmania mexicana cysteine protease CPB.,10.1002/cmdc.201000265,2010-08-28,[],"Cysteine proteases of the papain superfamily are present in nearly all eukaryotes and also play pivotal roles in the biology of parasites. Inhibition of cysteine proteases is emerging as an important strategy to combat parasitic diseases such as sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, and leishmaniasis. Inspired by the in vivo antiparasitic activity of the vinylsulfone-based cysteine protease inhibitors, a series of α-ketoheterocycles were developed as reversible inhibitors of a recombinant L. mexicana cysteine protease, CPB2.8. Three isoxazoles and especially one oxadiazole compound are potent reversible inhibitors of CPB2.8; however, in vitro whole-organism screening against a panel of protozoan parasites did not fully correlate with the observed inhibition of the cysteine protease."
1372,Targeting trypanothione metabolism in trypanosomatid human parasites.,10.2174/1389450111009011614,2010-08-26,[],"The diseases caused by the trypanosomatid parasites Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania are widely distributed throughout the world. Because of the toxic side-effects and the economically unviable cost of the currently used pharmaceutical treatments, the search for new drug targets continues. Since the antioxidant metabolism in these parasites relies on trypanothione [T(SH)(2)], a functional analog of glutathione, most of the pathway enzymes involved in its synthesis, utilization and reduction have been proposed as drug targets for therapeutic intervention. In the present review, the antioxidant metabolism and the phenotypic effects of inhibiting by genetic (RNA interference, knock-out) or chemical approaches, the T(SH)(2) and polyamine pathway enzymes in the parasites are analyzed. Although the genetic strategies are helpful in identifying essential genes for parasite survival/infectivity, they are less useful for drug-target validation. The effectiveness of targeting each pathway enzyme was evaluated by considering (i) the enzyme kinetic properties and antioxidant metabolite concentrations and (ii) the current knowledge and experimental approaches to the study of the control of fluxes and intermediary concentrations in metabolic pathways. The metabolic control analysis indicates that highly potent and specific inhibitors have to be designed for trypanothione reductase and the peroxide detoxification system, and hence other enzymes emerge (γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, trypanothione synthetase, ornithine decarboxylase, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and polyamine transporters) as alternative more suitable and effective drug targets in the antioxidant metabolism of trypanosomatids."
1373,OB-fold domain of KREPA4 mediates high-affinity interaction with guide RNA and possesses annealing activity.,10.1261/rna.2124610,2010-08-18,[],"KREPA4, also called MP24, is an essential mitochondrial guide RNA (gRNA)-binding protein with a preference for the 3' oligo(U) tail in trypanosomes. Structural prediction and compositional analysis of KREPA4 have identified a conserved OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding)-fold at the C-terminal end and two low compositional complexity regions (LCRs) at its N terminus. Concurrent with these predictions, one or both of these regions in KREPA4 protein may be involved in gRNA binding. To test this possibility, deletion mutants of KREPA4 were made and the effects on the gRNA-binding affinities were measured by quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The gRNA-binding specificities of these mutants were evaluated by competition experiments using gRNAs with U-tail deletions or stem-loop modifications and uridylated nonguide RNAs or heterologous RNA. Our results identified the predicted OB-fold as the functional domain of KREPA4 that mediates a high-affinity interaction with the gRNA oligo(U) tail. An additional contribution toward RNA-binding function was localized to LCRs that further stabilize the binding through sequence-specific interactions with the guide secondary structure. In this study we also found that the predicted OB-fold has an RNA annealing activity, representing the first report of such activity for a core component of the RNA editing complex."
1374,"16-bromoepiandrosterone, an activator of the mammalian immune system, inhibits glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma cruzi and is toxic to these parasites grown in culture.",10.1016/j.bmc.2010.05.008,2010-06-24,[],"Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) catalyzes the first step of the pentose-phosphate pathway which supplies cells with ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) and NADPH. R5P is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nucleotides while NADPH is the cofactor of several dehydrogenases acting in a broad range of biosynthetic processes and in the maintenance of the cellular redox state. RNA interference-mediated reduction of G6PDH levels in bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei validated this enzyme as a drug target against Human African Trypanosomiasis. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a human steroidal pro-hormone and its derivative 16α-bromoepiandrosterone (16BrEA) are uncompetitive inhibitors of mammalian G6PDH. Such steroids are also known to enhance the immune response in a broad range of animal infection models. It is noteworthy that the administration of DHEA to rats infected by Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Human American Trypanosomiasis (also known as Chagas' disease), reduces blood parasite levels at both acute and chronic infection stages. In the present work, we investigated the in vitro effect of DHEA derivatives on the proliferation of T. cruzi epimastigotes and their inhibitory effect on a recombinant form of the parasite's G6PDH (TcG6PDH). Our results show that DHEA and its derivative epiandrosterone (EA) are uncompetitive inhibitors of TcG6PDH, with K(i) values of 21.5 ± 0.5 and 4.8 ± 0.3 μM, respectively. Results from quantitative inhibition assays indicate 16BrEA as a potent inhibitor of TcG6PDH with an IC₅₀ of 86 ± 8 nM and those from in vitro cell viability assays confirm its toxicity for T. cruzi epimastigotes, with a LD₅₀ of 12 ± 8 μM. In summary, we demonstrated that, in addition to host immune response enhancement, 16BrEA has a direct effect on parasite viability, most likely as a consequence of TcG6PDH inhibition."
1375,Calflagin inhibition prolongs host survival and suppresses parasitemia in Trypanosoma brucei infection.,10.1128/EC.00086-10,2010-04-27,[],"African trypanosomes express a family of dually acylated, EF-hand calcium-binding proteins called the calflagins. These proteins associate with lipid raft microdomains in the flagellar membrane, where they putatively function as calcium signaling proteins. Here we show that these proteins bind calcium with high affinity and that their expression is regulated during the life cycle stage of the parasite, with protein levels approximately 10-fold higher in the mammalian bloodstream form than in the insect vector procyclic stage. We also demonstrate a role for the calflagins in mammalian infection, as inhibition of the entire calflagin family by RNA interference dramatically increased host survival and attenuated parasitemia in a mouse model of sleeping sickness. In contrast to infection with parental wild-type parasites, which demonstrated an unremitting parasitemia and death within 6 to 10 days, infection with calflagin-depleted parasites demonstrated prolonged survival associated with a sudden decrease in parasitemia at approximately 8 days postinfection. Subsequent relapsing and remitting waves of parasitemia thereafter were associated with alternate expression of the variant surface glycoprotein, suggesting that initial clearance was antigen specific. Interestingly, despite the notable in vivo phenotype and flagellar localization of the calflagins, in vitro analysis of the calflagin-deficient parasites demonstrated normal proliferation, flagellar motility, and morphology. Further analysis of the kinetics of surface antibody clearance also did not demonstrate a deficit in the calflagin-deficient parasites; thus, the molecular basis for the altered course of infection is independent of an effect on parasite cell cycle progression, motility, or degradation of surface-bound antibodies."
1376,Nuclear DBF-2-related kinases are essential regulators of cytokinesis in bloodstream stage Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.M109.074591,2010-03-17,[],"Nuclear DBF-2-related (NDR) kinases are essential regulators of cell cycle progression, growth, and development in many organisms and are activated by the binding of an Mps One Binder (MOB) protein partner, autophosphorylation, and phosphorylation by an upstream STE20 family kinase. In the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis, the NDR kinase, PK50, is expressed in proliferative life cycle stages and was shown to complement a yeast NDR kinase mutant cell line. However, the function of PK50 and a second NDR kinase, PK53, in T. brucei has not been determined to date, although trypanosome MOB1 is known to be essential for cytokinesis, suggesting the NDR kinases may also be involved in this process. Here, we show that specific depletion of PK50 or PK53 from bloodstream stage trypanosomes resulted in the rapid accumulation of cells with two nuclei and two kinetoplasts, indicating that cytokinesis was specifically inhibited. This led to a deregulation of the cell cycle and cell death and provides genetic validation of these kinases as potential novel drug targets for human African trypanosomiasis. Recombinant active PK50 and PK53 were produced and biochemically characterized. Both enzymes autophosphorylated, were able to trans-phosphorylate generic kinase substrates in vitro, and were active in the absence of phosphorylation by an upstream kinase. Additionally, both enzymes were active in the absence of MOB1 binding, which was also demonstrated to likely be a feature of the kinases in vivo. Biochemical characterization of recombinant PK50 and PK53 has revealed key kinetic differences between them, and the identification of in vitro peptide substrates in this study paves the way for high throughput inhibitor screening of these kinases."
1377,Quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase from Trypanosoma brucei: catalytic activity and mechanism of a QSOX family member with a single thioredoxin domain.,10.1021/bi902222s,2010-02-04,[],"Quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase (QSOX) flavoenzymes catalyze the direct, facile, insertion of disulfide bonds into reduced unfolded proteins with the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. To date, only QSOXs from vertebrates have been characterized enzymatically. These metazoan sulfhydryl oxidases have four recognizable domains: a redox-active thioredoxin (Trx) domain containing the first of three CxxC motifs (C(I)-C(II)), a second Trx domain with no obvious redox-active disulfide, a helix-rich domain, and then an Erv/ALR domain. This last domain contains the FAD moiety, a proximal C(III)-C(IV) disulfide, and a third CxxC of unknown function (C(V)-C(VI)). Plant and protist QSOXs lack the second Trx domain but otherwise appear to contain the same complement of redox centers. This work presents the first characterization of a single-Trx QSOX. Trypanosoma brucei QSOX was expressed in Escherichia coli using a synthetic gene and found to be a stable, monomeric, FAD-containing protein. Although evidently lacking an entire domain, TbQSOX shows catalytic activity and substrate specificity similar to the vertebrate QSOXs examined previously. Unfolded reduced proteins are more than 200-fold more effective substrates on a per thiol basis than glutathione and some 10-fold better than the parasite bisglutathione analogue, trypanothione. These data are consistent with a role for the protist QSOX in oxidative protein folding. Site-directed mutagenesis of each of the six cysteine residues (to serines) shows that the CxxC motif in the single-Trx domain is crucial for efficient catalysis of the oxidation of both reduced RNase and the model substrate dithiothreitol. As expected, the proximal disulfide C(III)-C(IV), which interacts with the flavin, is catalytically crucial. However, as observed with human QSOX1, the third CxxC motif shows no obvious catalytic role during the in vitro oxidation of reduced RNase or dithiothreitol. Pre-steady-state kinetics demonstrates that turnover in TbQSOX is limited by an internal redox step leading to 2-electron reduction of the FAD cofactor. In sum, the single-Trx domain QSOX studied here shows a striking similarity in enzymatic behavior to its double-Trx metazoan counterparts."
1378,Purification and kinetic characterization of recombinant alternative oxidase from Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1016/j.bbabio.2009.12.021,2010-01-09,[],"The trypanosome alternative oxidase (TAO) functions in the African trypanosomes as a cytochrome-independent terminal oxidase, which is essential for their survival in the mammalian host and as it does not exist in the mammalian host is considered to be a promising drug target for the treatment of trypanosomiasis. In the present study, recombinant TAO (rTAO) overexpressed in a haem-deficient Escherichia coli strain has been solubilized from E. coli membranes and purified to homogeneity in a stable and highly active form. Analysis of bound iron detected by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) reveals a stoichiometry of two bound iron atoms per monomer of rTAO. Confirmation that the rTAO was indeed a diiron protein was obtained by EPR analysis which revealed a signal, in the reduced forms of rTAO, with a g-value of 15. The kinetics of ubiquiol-1 oxidation by purified rTAO showed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics (K(m) of 338microM and V(max) of 601micromol/min/mg), whereas ubiquinol-2 oxidation showed unusual substrate inhibition. The specific inhibitor, ascofuranone, inhibited the enzyme in a mixed-type inhibition manner with respect to ubiquinol-1."

With the aim of creating new bisubstrate inhibitors of FTase, new farnesyl pyrophosphate analogues have been studied. Farnesyl analogues with a malonic acid function exhibited the best inhibitory activity on FTase. This group was introduced into our imidazole-containing model leading to new compounds with submicromolar activities. Kinetic experiments have been realized to determine their binding mode to the enzyme."
1380,GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase is essential in the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1042/BJ20090896,2009-11-19,[],"A putative GDP-Man PP (guanidine diphosphomannose pyrophosphorylase) gene from Trypanosoma brucei (TbGDP-Man PP) was identified in the genome and subsequently cloned, sequenced and recombinantly expressed, and shown to be a catalytically active dimer. Kinetic analysis revealed a Vmax of 0.34 mumol/min per mg of protein and Km values of 67 muM and 12 muM for GTP and mannose 1-phosphate respectively. Further kinetic studies showed GDP-Man was a potent product feedback inhibitor. RNAi (RNA interference) of the cytosolic TbGDP-Man PP showed that mRNA levels were reduced to ~20% of wild-type levels, causing the cells to die after 3-4 days, demonstrating that TbGDP-Man PP is essential in the bloodstream form of T. brucei and thus a potential drug target. The RNAi-induced parasites have a greatly reduced capability to form GDP-Man, leading ultimately to a reduction in their ability to synthesize their essential GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchors. The RNAi-induced parasites also showed aberrant N-glycosylation of their major cell-surface glycoprotein, variant surface glycoprotein, with loss of the high-mannose Man9GlcNAc2 N-glycosylation at Asn428 and formation of complex N-glycans at Asn263."
1384,Predictive computational models of substrate binding by a nucleoside transporter.,10.1074/jbc.M109.049726,2009-10-08,[],"Transporters play a vital role in both the resistance mechanisms of existing drugs and effective targeting of their replacements. Melarsoprol and diamidine compounds similar to pentamidine and furamidine are primarily taken up by trypanosomes of the genus Trypanosoma brucei through the P2 aminopurine transporter. In standardized competition experiments with [(3)H]adenosine, P2 transporter inhibition constants (K(i)) have been determined for a diverse dataset of adenosine analogs, diamidines, Food and Drug Administration-approved compounds and analogs thereof, and custom-designed trypanocidal compounds. Computational biology has been employed to investigate compound structure diversity in relation to P2 transporter interaction. These explorations have led to models for inhibition predictions of known and novel compounds to obtain information about the molecular basis for P2 transporter inhibition. A common pharmacophore for P2 transporter inhibition has been identified along with other key structural characteristics. Our model provides insight into P2 transporter interactions with known compounds and contributes to strategies for the design of novel antiparasitic compounds. This approach offers a quantitative and predictive tool for molecular recognition by specific transporters without the need for structural or even primary sequence information of the transport protein."
1386,Development and validation of a cytochrome c-coupled assay for pteridine reductase 1 and dihydrofolate reductase.,10.1016/j.ab.2009.09.003,2009-09-15,[],"Activity of the pterin- and folate-salvaging enzymes pteridine reductase 1 (PTR1) and dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthetase (DHFR-TS) is commonly measured as a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, corresponding to oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Although this assay has been adequate to study the biology of these enzymes, it is not amenable to support any degree of routine inhibitor assessment because its restricted linearity is incompatible with enhanced throughput microtiter plate screening. In this article, we report the development and validation of a nonenzymatically coupled screening assay in which the product of the enzymatic reaction reduces cytochrome c, causing an increase in absorbance at 550 nm. We demonstrate this assay to be robust and accurate, and we describe its utility in supporting a structure-based design, small-molecule inhibitor campaign against Trypanosoma brucei PTR1 and DHFR-TS."
1387,"Comparative structural, kinetic and inhibitor studies of Trypanosoma brucei trypanothione reductase with T. cruzi.",10.1016/j.molbiopara.2009.09.002,2009-09-15,[],"As part of a drug discovery programme to discover new treatments for human African trypanosomiasis, recombinant trypanothione reductase from Trypanosoma brucei has been expressed, purified and characterized. The crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement to a resolution of 2.3A and found to be nearly identical to the T. cruzi enzyme (root mean square deviation 0.6A over 482 Calpha atoms). Kinetically, the K(m) for trypanothione disulphide for the T. brucei enzyme was 4.4-fold lower than for T. cruzi measured by either direct (NADPH oxidation) or DTNB-coupled assay. The K(m) for NADPH for the T. brucei enzyme was found to be 0.77microM using an NADPH-regenerating system coupled to reduction of DTNB. Both enzymes were assayed for inhibition at their respective S=K(m) values for trypanothione disulphide using a range of chemotypes, including CNS-active drugs such as clomipramine, trifluoperazine, thioridazine and citalopram. The relative IC(50) values for the two enzymes were found to vary by no more than 3-fold. Thus trypanothione reductases from these species are highly similar in all aspects, indicating that they may be used interchangeably for structure-based inhibitor design and high-throughput screening."

Rhodesiense identified as the putative target of 4-[5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-2H-pyrazol-3-yl]morpholine using chemical proteomics.,10.1371/journal.pntd.0000506,2009-08-27,[],"Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), a major parasitic disease spread in Africa, urgently needs novel targets and new efficacious chemotherapeutic agents. Recently, we discovered that 4-[5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-2H-pyrazol-3-yl]morpholine (compound 1) exhibits specific antitrypanosomal activity with an IC(50) of 1.0 microM on Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (T. b. rhodesiense), the causative agent of the acute form of HAT.
In this work we show adenosine kinase of T. b. rhodesiense (TbrAK), a key enzyme of the parasite purine salvage pathway which is vital for parasite survival, to be the putative intracellular target of compound 1 using a chemical proteomics approach. This finding was confirmed by RNA interference experiments showing that down-regulation of adenosine kinase counteracts compound 1 activity. Further chemical validation demonstrated that compound 1 interacts specifically and tightly with TbrAK with nanomolar affinity, and in vitro activity measurements showed that compound 1 is an enhancer of TbrAK activity. The subsequent kinetic analysis provided strong evidence that the observed hyperactivation of TbrAK is due to the abolishment of the intrinsic substrate-inhibition.
The results suggest that TbrAK is the putative target of this compound, and that hyperactivation of TbrAK may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the development of trypanocides."

We report the crystal structures of three major parasite cysteine proteases, cruzain, falcipain-3, and the first reported structure of rhodesain, in complex with a class of potent, small molecule, cysteine protease inhibitors, the vinyl sulfones. These data, in conjunction with comparative inhibition kinetics, provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that drive cysteine protease inhibition by vinyl sulfones, the binding specificity of these important proteases and the potential of vinyl sulfones as antiparasitic drugs."
1391,Role of AP-1 in developmentally regulated lysosomal trafficking in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1128/EC.00156-09,2009-07-08,[],"African trypanosomes are the causative agents of human trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). The pathogenic stage of the parasite has unique adaptations to life in the bloodstream of the mammalian host, including upregulation of endocytic and lysosomal activities. We investigated stage-specific requirements for cytoplasmic adaptor/clathrin machinery in post-Golgi apparatus biosynthetic sorting to the lysosome using RNA interference silencing of the Tbmu1 subunit of adaptor complex 1 (AP-1), in conjunction with immunolocalization, kinetic analyses of reporter transport, and quantitative endocytosis assays. Tbmu1 silencing was lethal in both stages, indicating a critical function(s) for the AP-1 machinery. Transport of soluble and membrane-bound secretory cargoes was Tbmu1 independent in both stages. In procyclic parasites, trafficking of the lysosomal membrane protein, p67, was disrupted, leading to cell surface mislocalization. The lysosomal protease trypanopain was also secreted, suggesting a transmembrane-sorting receptor for this soluble hydrolase. In bloodstream trypanosomes, both p67 and trypanopain trafficking were unaffected by Tbmu1 silencing, suggesting that AP-1 is not necessary for biosynthetic lysosomal trafficking. Endocytosis in bloodstream cells was also unaffected, indicating that AP-1 does not function at the flagellar pocket. These results indicate that post-Golgi apparatus sorting to the lysosome is critically dependent on the AP-1/clathrin machinery in procyclic trypanosomes but that this machinery is not necessary in bloodstream parasites. We propose a simple model for stage-specific default secretory trafficking in trypanosomes that is consistent with the behavior of other soluble and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cargos and which is influenced by upregulation of endocytosis in bloodstream parasites as an adaptation to life in the mammalian bloodstream."

10.1186/1471-2199-3-7",2009-06-23,[],"A new member of the FHIT protein family, designated HIT-45, has been identified in the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei. Recombinant HIT-45 proteins were purified from trypanosomal and bacterial protein expression systems and analyzed for substrate specificity using various dinucleoside polyphosphates, including those that contain the 5'-mRNA cap, i.e., m(7)GMP. This enzyme exhibited typical dinucleoside triphosphatase activity (EC 3.6.1.29), having its highest specificity for diadenosine triphosphate (ApppA). However, the trypanosome enzyme contains a unique amino-terminal extension, and hydrolysis of cap dinucleotides with monomethylated guanosine or dimethylated guanosine always yielded m(7)GMP (or m(2,7)GMP) as one of the reaction products. Interestingly, m(7)Gpppm(3)(N6, N6, 2'O)A was preferred among the methylated substrates. This hypermethylated dinucleotide is unique to trypanosomes and may be an intermediate in the decay of cap 4, i.e., m(7)Gpppm(3)(N6, N6, 2'O)Apm(2'O)Apm(2'O)Cpm(2)(N3, 2'O)U, that occurs in these organisms."

Polyamines are small organic cations that are required for cell growth and their biosynthesis has been the target of drug discovery efforts in both T. cruzi and the related Trypanosoma brucei parasites. Here we show that, as previously demonstrated for T. brucei, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) from T. cruzi forms a heterodimer with prozyme, an inactive homolog that arose by gene duplication of the canonical enzyme uniquely in the trypanosomatids. The T. cruzi AdoMetDC/prozyme heterodimer is 110-fold more active than homodimeric AdoMetDC. Unlike for T. brucei AdoMetDC, the activity of the T. cruzi heterodimer is further stimulated by putrescine to generate an enzyme with similar catalytic efficiency to the fully activated T. brucei enzyme. The effects of prozyme on T. cruzi AdoMetDC are mediated by an increase in k(cat), while the predominant effect of putrescine is to lower the K(m). Finally we demonstrate that the cross-species heterodimers of T. cruzi and T. brucei AdoMetDC and prozyme pairs are functional, and that putrescine is required for prozyme to fully activate the mixed species heterodimers. These data demonstrate that prozyme mediated activation of AdoMetDC is a common mechanism required to regulate AdoMetDC activity in the trypanosomatids."

A null mutant of the highly homologous casein kinase 1 isoform 1 (Tb927.5.790) in bloodstream form T. brucei displays no growth or morphological phenotype in vitro. A truncated form of TbCK1.2 expressed in Escherichia coli as a GST fusion produces catalytically active recombinant protein, facilitating screening for small molecule inhibitors. These data show that TbCK1.2 is an attractive target for anti-trypanosomal drug discovery."
1395,The enzymes of the 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate synthetic pathway are found exclusively in the cytosol of the trypanosomatid parasite Leishmania major.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2009.03.009,2009-05-20,[],"In most organisms 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (10-CHO-THF) participates in the synthesis of purines in the cytosol and formylation of mitochondrial initiator methionyl-tRNA(Met). Here we studied 10-CHO-THF biosynthesis in the protozoan parasite Leishmania major, a purine auxotroph. Two distinct synthetic enzymes are known, a bifunctional methylene-tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase (DHCH) or formyl-tetrahydrofolate ligase (FTL), and phylogenomic profiling revealed considerable diversity for these in trypanosomatids. All species surveyed contain a DHCH1, which was shown recently to be essential in L. major. A second DHCH2 occurred only in L. infantum, L. mexicana and T. cruzi, and as a pseudogene in L. major. DHCH2s bear N-terminal extensions and we showed a LiDHCH2-GFP fusion was targeted to the mitochondrion. FTLs were found in all species except Trypanosoma brucei. L. major ftl(-) null mutants were phenotypically normal in growth, differentiation, animal infectivity and sensitivity to a panel of pteridine analogs, but grew more slowly when starved for serine or glycine, as expected for amino acids that are substrates in C1-folate metabolism. Cell fractionation and western blotting showed that both L. major DHCH1 and FTL were localized to the cytosol and not the mitochondrion. These localization data predict that in L. major cytosolic 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate must be transported into the mitochondrion to support methionyl-tRNA(Met) formylation. The retention in all the trypanosomatids of at least one enzyme involved in 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis, and the essentiality of this metabolite in L. major, suggests that this pathway represents a promising new area for chemotherapeutic attack in these parasites."
1396,Functional characterization of stage-specific aminotransferases from trypanosomatids.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2009.04.001,2009-05-16,[],"As part of a study on aminotransferases, genes coding for putative enzymes from Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major (alanine aminotransferases: ALATs, Tb927.1.3950 and LmjF12.0630; kynurenine aminotransferase: KAT, Tb10.389.1810; and tyrosine aminotransferase: TAT, LmjF36.2360) were cloned and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. The putative T. brucei KAT, in fact coded for a glutamine aminotransferase (GlnAT), which exhibited a notably high affinity (in the micromolar range) towards glutamine and cysteine; in addition, like bacterial GlnATs and mammalian KATs, it was able to utilize different 2-oxoacids as amino acceptors. L. major TAT resembled T. cruzi TAT in substrate specificity, although the leishmanial enzyme did not exhibit ALAT activity. On the other hand, T. brucei ALAT, shortened by the first 65 amino acids assigned in the data bases, was functional and actively transaminated the substrate pair l-alanine and 2-oxoglutarate. Moreover in Western blots, the molecular size of the protein detected in crude extracts of T. brucei procyclics was identical to the value of the recombinant enzyme. Like T. brucei and T. cruzi orthologues, L. major ALAT displayed narrow substrate specificity. The leishmanial ALAT, like the T. cruzi enzyme, exhibited a dual subcellular localization, in the cytosol and in the mitochondrion. In line with the findings of comparative proteomic analyses of insect and mammalian stages of T. brucei and Leishmania parasites, our results also showed that T. cruzi ALAT is constitutively expressed, with remarkably higher levels being detected in amastigotes than in epimastigotes. ALATs are expressed in the clinically important stages of TriTryps, probably fulfilling an essential role, which deserves further studies."

The purified ACP emerged as three distinct peaks (ACP I, ACP II and ACP III) with high specific activities and they moved homogeneously on 12% SDS-PAGE each as a single band with relative molecular weight of 36 kDa, 25 kDa and 45 kDa respectively. The purified enzymes were active at an optimum pH and temperature of 5.5 and 40 degrees C respectively. The enzyme activities appeared to be ACP because their activities were enhanced at low pH values and inhibited by the acid phosphatase inhibitor, sodium fluoride. ACP I and ACP II were sensitive to l-tartrate while ACP III was insensitive to l tartrate. The kinetic analysis of the purified enzyme (ACP I, ACP II and ACP III) determined using para-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate gave KM values of 0.2 mM, 0.15 mM and 0.5 mM. Monofunctional group sulfhydryl group inhibitors; HgCl2, and AgCl2 strongly inhibited the activity of ACP III and millimolar concentrations of dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide activated and inhibited the activity of the ACP III respectively, suggesting the involvement of thiol groups at the active site of the enzyme. Thus, differentiating it from ACP I and ACP II. The implication of these findings in relation to the pathology of trypanosomosis is discussed."
1398,Novel S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase inhibitors for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis.,10.1128/AAC.01674-08,2009-03-18,[],"Trypanosomiasis remains a significant disease across the sub-Saharan African continent, with 50,000 to 70,000 individuals infected. The utility of current therapies is limited by issues of toxicity and the need to administer compounds intravenously. We have begun a program to pursue lead optimization around MDL 73811, an irreversible inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC). This compound is potent but in previous studies cleared rapidly from the blood of rats (T. L. Byers, T. L. Bush, P. P. McCann, and A. J. Bitonti, Biochem. J. 274:527-533). One of the analogs synthesized (Genz-644131) was shown to be highly active against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense in vitro (50% inhibitory concentration, 400 pg/ml). Enzyme kinetic studies showed Genz-644131 to be approximately fivefold more potent than MDL 73811 against the T. brucei brucei AdoMetDC-prozyme complex. This compound was stable in vitro in rat and human liver microsomal and hepatocyte assays, was stable in rat whole-blood assays, did not significantly inhibit human cytochrome P450 enzymes, had no measurable efflux in CaCo-2 cells, and was only 41% bound by serum proteins. Pharmacokinetic studies of mice following intraperitoneal dosing showed that the half-life of Genz-644131 was threefold greater than that of MDL 73811 (7.4 h versus 2.5 h). Furthermore, brain penetration of Genz-644131 was 4.3-fold higher than that of MDL 73811. Finally, in vivo efficacy studies of T. b. brucei strain STIB 795-infected mice showed that Genz-644131 significantly extended survival (from 6.75 days for controls to >30 days for treated animals) and cured animals infected with T. b. brucei strain LAB 110 EATRO. Taken together, the data strengthen validation of AdoMetDC as an important parasite target, and these studies have shown that analogs of MDL 73811 can be synthesized with improved potency and brain penetration."
1399,A type III protein arginine methyltransferase from the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.M807279200,2009-03-04,[],"Arginine methylation is a widespread post-translational modification of proteins catalyzed by a family of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). The ancient protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, possesses five putative PRMTs, a relatively large number for a single-celled eukaryote. Trypanosomatids lack gene regulation at the level of transcription, instead relying on post-transcriptional control mechanisms that act at the levels of RNA turnover, translation, and editing, all processes that likely involve multiple RNA-binding proteins, which are common targets of arginine methylation. Here, we report the characterization of a trypanosome PRMT, TbPRMT7, which is homologous to human PRMT7. Interestingly, trypanosomatids are the only single-celled eukaryotes known to harbor a PRMT7 homologue. TbPRMT7 differs dramatically from all known metazoan PRMT7 homologues in lacking the second AdoMet binding-like domain that is required for activity of the human enzyme. Nevertheless, bacterially expressed TbPRMT7 exhibits robust methyltransferase activity toward multiple targets in vitro. High resolution ion exchange chromatography analysis of methylated substrates reveals that TbPRMT7 is a type III PRMT, catalyzing the formation of only monomethylarginine, thereby representing the only exclusively type III PRMT identified to date. TbPRMT7 is expressed in both mammalian and insect stage T. brucei and is apparently dispensable for growth in both life cycle stages. The enzyme is cytoplasmically localized and is a component of several higher order complexes in vivo. Together, our studies indicate that TbPRMT7 is a Type III PRMT, and its robust activity and presence in numerous complexes suggest it plays multiple roles during the complex T. brucei life cycle."
1400,Identification of a palmitoyl acyltransferase required for protein sorting to the flagellar membrane.,10.1242/jcs.041764,2009-02-26,[],"Protein palmitoylation has diverse effects in regulating protein membrane affinity, localization, binding partner interactions, turnover and function. Here, we show that palmitoylation also contributes to the sorting of proteins to the eukaryotic flagellum. African trypanosomes are protozoan pathogens that express a family of unique Ca(2+)-binding proteins, the calflagins, which undergo N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation. The localization of calflagins depends on their acylation status. Myristoylation alone is sufficient for membrane association, but, in the absence of palmitoylation, the calflagins localize to the pellicular (cell body) membrane. Palmitoylation, which is mediated by a specific palmitoyl acyltransferase, is then required for subsequent trafficking of calflagin to the flagellar membrane. Coincident with the redistribution of calflagin from the pellicular to the flagellar membrane is their association with lipid rafts, which are highly enriched in the flagellar membrane. Screening of candidate palmitoyl acyltranferases identified a single enzyme, TbPAT7, that is necessary for calflagin palmitoylation and flagellar membrane targeting. Our results implicate protein palmitoylation in flagellar trafficking, and demonstrate the conservation and specificity of palmitoyl acyltransferase activity by DHHC-CRD proteins across kingdoms."
1401,Characterization of trifluralin binding with recombinant tubulin from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1007/s00436-008-1271-2,2008-12-04,[],"The binding kinetics of five novel trifluralin analogs with recombinant alpha- and beta-tubulin proteins from Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense was determined. Native tubulin from rats was used to determine the extent of binding of each analog to mammalian tubulin. The results of this study clearly demonstrate two important characteristics of the binding of these trifluralins to tubulin. Firstly, they have specific affinity for trypanosomal tubulin compared with mammalian tubulin irrespective of the chemical composition of the trifluralin analog tested. Secondly, they have a stronger affinity for trypanosomal alpha-tubulin compared with trypanosomal beta-tubulin. In addition, compounds 1007, 1008, 1016, and 1017 have strong binding affinities for alpha-tubulin, with limited binding affinity for mammalian tubulin, which indicates that these compounds selectively bind to trypanosomal tubulin."

The Trypanosoma brucei genome project has identified 12 members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family, most of which have been characterized previously as nucleoside and/or nucleobase transporters. Here the 11th member of this family, TbNT11.1, has been functionally expressed in null mutants of Leishmania that are deficient in purine nucleoside or nucleobase uptake and identified as a high-affinity purine nucleobase transporter. Expression of TbNT11.1 in Xenopus oocytes revealed that it is also a transporter for the diamidine drug pentamidine that is the principal drug employed to treat early stage human African trypanosomiasis and may thus contribute to the uptake of this therapeutically important compound. In addition, characterization of the 12th member of the family, TbNT12.1, reveals that it is an adenine/pentamidine transporter."
1403,Between-species variation in the kinetic stability of TIM proteins linked to solvation-barrier free energies.,10.1016/j.jmb.2008.10.056,2008-11-11,[],"Theoretical, computational, and experimental studies have suggested the existence of solvation barriers in protein unfolding and denaturation processes. These barriers are related to the finite size of water molecules and can be envisioned as arising from the asynchrony between water penetration and breakup of internal interactions. Solvation barriers have been proposed to play roles in protein cooperativity and kinetic stability; therefore, they may be expected to be subject to natural selection. We study the thermal denaturation, in the presence and in the absence of chemical denaturants, of triosephosphate isomerases (TIMs) from three different species: Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, and Leishmania mexicana. In all cases, denaturation was irreversible and kinetically controlled. Surprisingly, however, we found large differences between the kinetic denaturation parameters, with T. cruzi TIM showing a much larger activation energy value (and, consequently, much lower room-temperature, extrapolated denaturation rates). This disparity cannot be accounted for by variations in the degree of exposure to solvent in transition states (as measured by kinetic urea m values) and is, therefore, to be attributed mainly to differences in solvation-barrier contributions. This was supported by structure-energetics analyses of the transition states and by application of a novel procedure to estimate from experimental data the solvation-barrier impact at the entropy and free-energy levels. These analyses were actually performed with an extended protein set (including six small proteins plus seven variants of lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus and spanning a wide range of activation parameters), allowing us to delineate the general trends of the solvation-barrier contributions. Overall, this work supports that proteins sharing the same structure and function but belonging to different organisms may show widely different solvation barriers, possibly as a result of different levels of the selection pressure associated with cooperativity, kinetic stability, and related factors."

The kinetic mechanism for glutathionylspermidine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.8) from Crithidia fasciculata (CfGspS) obeys a rapid equilibrium random ter-ter model with kinetic constants K(GSH) = 609 microM, K(Spd) = 157 microM and K(ATP) = 215 microM. Phosphonate and phosphinate analogues of glutathionylspermidine, previously shown to be potent inhibitors of GspS from Escherichia coli, are equally potent against CfGspS. The tetrahedral phosphonate acts as a simple ground state analogue of glutathione (GSH) (K(i) approximately 156 microM), whereas the phosphinate behaves as a stable mimic of the postulated unstable tetrahedral intermediate. Kinetic studies showed that the phosphinate behaves as a slow-binding bisubstrate inhibitor [competitive with respect to GSH and spermidine (Spd)] with rate constants k(3) (on rate) = 6.98 x 10(4) M(-1) x s(-1) and k(4) (off rate) = 1.3 x 10(-3) s(-1), providing a dissociation constant K(i) = 18.6 nM. The phosphinate analogue also inhibited recombinant trypanothione synthetase (EC 6.3.1.9) from C. fasciculata, Leishmania major, Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei with K(i)(app) values 20-40-fold greater than that of CfGspS.

1406,Biochemical characterization of stage-specific isoforms of aspartate aminotransferases from Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2008.05.005,2008-07-08,[],"Three genes encoding putative aspartate aminotransferases (ASATs) were identified in the Trypanosoma cruzi genome. Two of these ASAT genes, presumably corresponding to a cytosolic and mitochondrial isoform, were cloned and expressed as soluble His-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli. The specific activities determined for both T. cruzi isozymes were notably higher than the values previously reported for Trypanosoma brucei orthologues. To confirm these differences, T. brucei mASAT and cASAT were also expressed as His-tagged enzymes. The kinetic analysis showed that the catalytic parameters of the new recombinant T. brucei ASATs were very similar to those determined for T. cruzi orthologues. The cASATs from both parasites displayed equally broad substrate specificities, while mASATs were highly specific towards aspartate/2-oxoglutarate. The subcellular localization of the mASAT was confirmed by digitonin extraction of intact epimastigotes. At the protein level, cASAT is constitutively expressed in T. brucei, whereas mASAT is down-regulated in the bloodstream forms. By contrast in T. cruzi, mASAT is expressed along the whole life cycle, whereas cASAT is specifically induced in the mammalian stages. Similarly, the expression of malate dehydrogenases (MDHs) is developmentally regulated in T. cruzi: while glycosomal MDH is only expressed in epimastigotes and mitochondrial MDH is present in the insect and mammalian stages. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for a metabolically active mitochondrion in the mammalian stages of T. cruzi, and suggest that the succinate excreted by amastigotes more likely represents a side product of an at least partially operative Krebs cycle, than an end product of glycosomal catabolism."

Immune evasion relies on two important features: exposing a single type of VSG at the cell surface and periodically and very rapidly switching the expressed VSG. Transcriptional switching between resident telomeric VSG genes does not involve DNA rearrangements, and regulation is probably epigenetic. The histone methyltransferase DOT1B is a nonessential protein that trimethylates lysine 76 of histone H3 in Trypanosoma brucei. Here we report that transcriptionally silent telomeric VSGs become partially derepressed when DOT1B is deleted, whereas nontelomeric loci are unaffected. DOT1B also is involved in the kinetics of VSG switching: in DeltaDOT1B cells, the transcriptional switch is so slow that cells expressing two VSGs persist for several weeks, indicating that monoallelic transcription is compromised. We conclude that DOT1B is required to maintain strict VSG silencing and to ensure rapid transcriptional VSG switching, demonstrating that epigenetics plays an important role in regulating antigenic variation in T. brucei."
1409,Structural and mechanistic insights into type II trypanosomatid tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidases.,10.1042/BJ20080889,2008-06-05,[],"TbTDPX (Trypanosoma brucei tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidase) is a genetically validated drug target in the fight against African sleeping sickness. Despite its similarity to members of the GPX (glutathione peroxidase) family, TbTDPX2 is functional as a monomer, lacks a selenocysteine residue and relies instead on peroxidatic and resolving cysteine residues for catalysis and uses tryparedoxin rather than glutathione as electron donor. Kinetic studies indicate a saturable Ping Pong mechanism, unlike selenium-dependent GPXs, which display infinite K(m) and V(max) values. The structure of the reduced enzyme at 2.1 A (0.21 nm) resolution reveals that the catalytic thiol groups are widely separated [19 A (0.19 nm)] and thus unable to form a disulphide bond without a large conformational change in the secondary-structure architecture, as reported for certain plant GPXs. A model of the oxidized enzyme structure is presented and the implications for small-molecule inhibition are discussed."
1410,Biochemical characterization of the initial steps of the Kennedy pathway in Trypanosoma brucei: the ethanolamine and choline kinases.,10.1042/BJ20080435,2008-05-21,[],"Ethanolamine and choline are major components of the trypanosome membrane phospholipids, in the form of GPEtn (phosphatidylethanolamine) [corrected] and GPCho (phosphatidylcholine) [corrected] . Ethanolamine is also found as an integral component of the GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor that is required for membrane attachment of cell-surface proteins, most notably the variant-surface glycoproteins. The de novo synthesis of GPEtn and GPCho starts with the generation of phosphoethanolamine and phosphocholine by ethanolamine and choline kinases via the Kennedy pathway. Database mining revealed two putative C/EKs (choline/ethanolamine kinases) in the Trypanosoma brucei genome, which were cloned, overexpressed, purified and characterized. TbEK1 (T. brucei ethanolamine kinase 1) was shown to be catalytically active as an ethanolamine-specific kinase, i.e. it had no choline kinase activity. The K(m) values for ethanolamine and ATP were found to be 18.4+/-0.9 and 219+/-29 microM respectively. TbC/EK2 (T. brucei choline/ethanolamine kinase 2), on the other hand, was found to be able to phosphorylate both ethanolamine and choline, even though choline was the preferred substrate, with a K(m) 80 times lower than that of ethanolamine. The K(m) values for choline, ethanolamine and ATP were 31.4+/-2.6 microM, 2.56+/-0.31 mM and 20.6+/-1.96 microM respectively. Further substrate specificity analysis revealed that both TbEK1 and TbC/EK2 were able to tolerate various modifications at the amino group, with the exception of a quaternary amine for TbEK1 (choline) and a primary amine for TbC/EK2 (ethanolamine). Both enzymes recognized analogues with substituents on C-2, but substitutions on C-1 and elongations of the carbon chain were not well tolerated."
1411,3' adenylation determines mRNA abundance and monitors completion of RNA editing in T. brucei mitochondria.,10.1038/emboj.2008.87,2008-05-10,[],"Expression of the mitochondrial genome in protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is controlled post-transcriptionally and requires extensive U-insertion/deletion mRNA editing. In mitochondrial extracts, 3' adenylation reportedly influences degradation kinetics of synthetic edited and pre-edited mRNAs. We have identified and characterized a mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase, termed KPAP1, and determined major polypeptides in the polyadenylation complex. Inhibition of KPAP1 expression abrogates short and long A-tails typically found in mitochondrial mRNAs, and decreases the abundance of never-edited and edited transcripts. Pre-edited mRNAs are not destabilized by the lack of 3' adenylation, whereas short A-tails are required and sufficient to maintain the steady-state levels of partially edited, fully edited, and never-edited mRNAs. The editing directed by a single guide RNA is sufficient to impose a requirement for the short A-tail in edited molecules. Upon completion of the editing process, the short A-tails are extended as (A/U) heteropolymers into structures previously thought to be long poly(A) tails. These data provide the first direct evidence of functional interactions between 3' processing and editing of mitochondrial mRNAs in trypanosomes."
1412,Sequence homology and microhomology dominate chromosomal double-strand break repair in African trypanosomes.,10.1093/nar/gkn104,2008-03-13,[],"Genetic diversity in fungi and mammals is generated through mitotic double-strand break-repair (DSBR), typically involving homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Microhomology-mediated joining appears to serve a subsidiary function. The African trypanosome, a divergent protozoan parasite, relies upon rearrangement of subtelomeric variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes to achieve antigenic variation. Evidence suggests an absence of NHEJ but chromosomal repair remains largely unexplored. We used a system based on I-SceI meganuclease and monitored temporally constrained DSBR at a specific chromosomal site in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei. In response to the lesion, adjacent single-stranded DNA was generated; the homologous strand-exchange factor, Rad51, accumulated into foci; a G(2)M checkpoint was activated and >50% of cells displayed successful repair. Quantitative analysis of DSBR pathways employed indicated that inter-chromosomal HR dominated. HR displayed a strong preference for the allelic template but also the capacity to interact with homologous sequence on heterologous chromosomes. Intra-chromosomal joining was predominantly, and possibly exclusively, microhomology mediated, a situation unique among organisms examined to date. These DSBR pathways available to T. brucei likely underlie patterns of antigenic variation and the evolution of the vast VSG gene family."

Hence, we evaluated the essentiality of one enzyme in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) from the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma brucei through gene knockdown studies. RNAi knockdown of DHODH expression in bloodstream form T. brucei did not inhibit growth in normal medium, but profoundly retarded growth in pyrimidine-depleted media or in the presence of the known pyrimidine uptake antagonist 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). These results have significant implications for the development of therapeutics to combat T. brucei infection. Specifically, a combination therapy including a T. brucei-specific DHODH inhibitor plus 5-FU may prove to be an effective therapeutic strategy. We also show that this trypanosomal enzyme is inhibited by known inhibitors of bacterial Class 1A DHODH, in distinction to the sensitivity of DHODH from human and other higher eukaryotes. This selectivity is supported by the crystal structure of the T. brucei enzyme, which is reported here at a resolution of 1.95 A. Additional research, guided by the crystal structure described herein, is needed to identify potent inhibitors of T. brucei DHODH."
1415,Deletion of the TbALG3 gene demonstrates site-specific N-glycosylation and N-glycan processing in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1093/glycob/cwn014,2008-02-12,[],"We recently suggested a novel site-specific N-glycosylation mechanism in Trypanosoma brucei whereby some protein N-glycosylation sites selectively receive Man9GlcNAc2 from Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol while others receive Man5GlcNA(2 from Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol. In this paper, we test this model by creating procyclic and bloodstream form null mutants of TbALG3, the gene that encodes the alpha-mannosyltransferase that converts Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol to Man6GlcNAc2-PP-Dol. The procyclic and bloodstream form TbALG3 null mutants grow with normal kinetics, remain infectious to mice and tsetse flies, respectively, and have normal morphology. However, both forms display aberrant N-glycosylation of their major surface glycoproteins, procylcin, and variant surface glycoprotein, respectively. Specifically, procyclin and variant surface glycoprotein N-glycosylation sites that are modified with Man9GlcNAc2 and processed no further than Man5GlcNAc2 in the wild type are glycosylated less efficiently but processed to complex structures in the mutant. These data confirm our model and refine it by demonstrating that the biantennary glycan transferred from Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol is the only route to complex N-glycans in T. brucei and that Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol is strictly a precursor for oligomannose structures. The origins of site-specific Man5GlcNAc2 or Man9GlcNAc2 transfer are discussed and an updated model of N-glycosylation in T. brucei is presented."
1416,Acetylation-dependent ADP-ribosylation by Trypanosoma brucei Sir2.,10.1074/jbc.M707613200,2008-01-01,[],"Sirtuins are a highly conserved family of proteins implicated in diverse cellular processes such as gene silencing, aging, and metabolic regulation. Although many sirtuins catalyze a well characterized protein/histone deacetylation reaction, there are a number of reports that suggest protein ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Here we explored the mechanisms of ADP-ribosylation using the Trypanosoma brucei Sir2 homologue TbSIR2rp1 as a model for sirtuins that reportedly display both activities. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed a highly active histone deacetylase (k cat = 0.1 s(-1), with Km values of 42 microm and for NAD+ and 65 microm for acetylated substrate). A series of biochemical assays revealed that TbSIR2rp1 ADP-ribosylation of protein/histone requires an acetylated substrate. The data are consistent with two distinct ADP-ribosylation pathways that involve an acetylated substrate, NAD+ and TbSIR2rp1 as follows: 1) a noncatalytic reaction between the deacetylation product O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (or its hydrolysis product ADP-ribose) and histones, and 2) a more efficient mechanism involving interception of an ADP-ribose-acetylpeptide-enzyme intermediate by a side-chain nucleophile from bound histone. However, the sum of both ADP-ribosylation reactions was approximately 5 orders of magnitude slower than histone deacetylation under identical conditions. The biological implications of these results are discussed."
1417,Kinetic and mutational analysis of the Trypanosoma brucei NBT1 nucleobase transporter expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals structural similarities between ENT and MFS transporters.,10.1016/j.ijpara.2007.10.005,2007-11-27,[],"Parasitic protozoa are unable to synthesise purines de novo and thus depend on the uptake of nucleosides and nucleobases across their plasma membrane through specific transporters. A number of nucleoside and nucleobase transporters from Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Leishmania major have recently been characterised and shown to belong to the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) family. A number of studies have demonstrated the functional importance of particular transmembrane segments (TMS) in nucleoside-specific ENT proteins. TbNBT1, one of only three bona fide nucleobase-selective members of the ENT family, has previously been shown to be a high-affinity transporter for purine nucleobases and guanosine. In this study, we use the Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system to build a biochemical model of how TbNBT1 recognises nucleobases. We next performed random in vitro and site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues critical for TbNBT1 function. The identification of residues likely to contribute to permeant binding, when combined with a structural model of TbNBT1 obtained by homology threading, yield a tentative three-dimensional model of the transporter binding site that is consistent with the binding model emerging from the biochemical data. The model strongly suggests the involvement of TMS5, TMS7 and TMS8 in TbNBT1 function. This situation is very similar to that concerning transporters of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), one of which was used as a template for the threading. This point raises the possibility that ENT and MFS carriers, despite being considered evolutionarily distinct, might in fact share similar topologies and substrate translocations pathways."
1418,Acetate:succinate CoA-transferase in the hydrogenosomes of Trichomonas vaginalis: identification and characterization.,10.1074/jbc.M702528200,2007-11-21,[],"Acetate:succinate CoA-transferases (ASCT) are acetate-producing enzymes in hydrogenosomes, anaerobically functioning mitochondria and in the aerobically functioning mitochondria of trypanosomatids. Although acetate is produced in the hydrogenosomes of a number of anaerobic microbial eukaryotes such as Trichomonas vaginalis, no acetate producing enzyme has ever been identified in these organelles. Acetate production is the last unidentified enzymatic reaction of hydrogenosomal carbohydrate metabolism. We identified a gene encoding an enzyme for acetate production in the genome of the hydrogenosome-containing protozoan parasite T. vaginalis. This gene shows high similarity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae acetyl-CoA hydrolase and Clostridium kluyveri succinyl-CoA:CoA-transferase. Here we demonstrate that this protein is expressed and is present in the hydrogenosomes where it functions as the T. vaginalis acetate:succinate CoA-transferase (TvASCT). Heterologous expression of TvASCT in CHO cells resulted in the expression of an active ASCT. Furthermore, homologous overexpression of the TvASCT gene in T. vaginalis resulted in an equivalent increase in ASCT activity. It was shown that the CoA transferase activity is succinate-dependent. These results demonstrate that this acetyl-CoA hydrolase/transferase homolog functions as the hydrogenosomal ASCT of T. vaginalis. This is the first hydrogenosomal acetate-producing enzyme to be identified. Interestingly, TvASCT does not share any similarity with the mitochondrial ASCT from Trypanosoma brucei, the only other eukaryotic succinate-dependent acetyl-CoA-transferase identified so far. The trichomonad enzyme clearly belongs to a distinct class of acetate:succinate CoA-transferases. Apparently, two completely different enzymes for succinate-dependent acetate production have evolved independently in ATP-generating organelles."
1419,Thermodynamic characterization of substrate and inhibitor binding to Trypanosoma brucei 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase.,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.06160.x,2007-11-21,[],"6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is a potential target for new drugs against African trypanosomiasis. Phosphorylated aldonic acids are strong inhibitors of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and 4-phospho-d-erythronate (4PE) and 4-phospho-d-erythronohydroxamate are two of the strongest inhibitors of the Trypanosoma brucei enzyme. Binding of the substrate 6-phospho-d-gluconate (6PG), the inhibitors 5-phospho-d-ribonate (5PR) and 4PE, and the coenzymes NADP, NADPH and NADP analogue 3-amino-pyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate to 6-phospho-d-gluconate dehydrogenase from T. brucei was studied using isothermal titration calorimetry. Binding of the substrate (K(d) = 5 microm) and its analogues (K(d) =1.3 microm and K(d) = 2.8 microm for 5PR and 4PE, respectively) is entropy driven, whereas binding of the coenzymes is enthalpy driven. Oxidized coenzyme and its analogue, but not reduced coenzyme, display a half-site reactivity in the ternary complex with the substrate or inhibitors. Binding of 6PG and 5PR poorly affects the dissociation constant of the coenzymes, whereas binding of 4PE decreases the dissociation constant of the coenzymes by two orders of magnitude. In a similar manner, the K(d) value of 4PE decreases by two orders of magnitude in the presence of the coenzymes. The results suggest that 5PR acts as a substrate analogue, whereas 4PE mimics the transition state of dehydrogenation. The stronger affinity of 4PE is interpreted on the basis of the mechanism of the enzyme, suggesting that the inhibitor forces the catalytic lysine 185 into the protonated state."
1420,Control and regulation of gene expression: quantitative analysis of the expression of phosphoglycerate kinase in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.M705782200,2007-11-10,[],"Isoenzymes of phosphoglycerate kinase in Trypanosoma brucei are differentially expressed in its two main life stages. This study addresses how the organism manages to make sufficient amounts of the isoenzyme with the correct localization, which processes (transcription, splicing, and RNA degradation) control the levels of mRNAs, and how the organism regulates the switch in isoform expression. For this, we combined new quantitative measurements of phosphoglycerate kinase mRNA abundance, RNA precursor stability, trans splicing, and ribosome loading with published data and made a kinetic computer model. For the analysis of regulation we extended regulation analysis. Although phosphoglycerate kinase mRNAs are present at surprisingly low concentrations (e.g. 12 molecules per cell), its protein is highly abundant. Substantial control of mRNA and protein levels was exerted by both mRNA synthesis and degradation, whereas splicing and precursor degradation had little control on mRNA and protein concentrations. Yet regulation of mRNA levels does not occur by transcription, but by adjusting mRNA degradation. The contribution of splicing to regulation is negligible, as for all cases where splicing is faster than RNA precursor degradation."
1421,Hydrodynamic flow-mediated protein sorting on the cell surface of trypanosomes.,10.1016/j.cell.2007.08.046,2007-11-06,[],"The unicellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei rapidly removes host-derived immunoglobulin (Ig) from its cell surface, which is dominated by a single type of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). We have determined the mechanism of antibody clearance and found that Ig-VSG immune complexes are passively sorted to the posterior cell pole, where they are endocytosed. The backward movement of immune complexes requires forward cellular motility but is independent of endocytosis and of actin function. We suggest that the hydrodynamic flow acting on swimming trypanosomes causes directional movement of Ig-VSG immune complexes in the plane of the plasma membrane, that is, immunoglobulins attached to VSG function as molecular sails. Protein sorting by hydrodynamic forces helps to protect trypanosomes against complement-mediated immune destruction in culture and possibly in infected mammals but likewise may be of functional significance at the surface of other cell types such as epithelial cells lining blood vessels."
1422,Interleukin-12p70-dependent interferon- gamma production is crucial for resistance in African trypanosomiasis.,10.1086/521681,2007-10-24,[],"African trypanosomiasis encompasses diseases caused by pathogenic trypanosomes, infecting both humans and animals. In the present article, we dissected the possible role of members of the interleukin (IL)-12 family during infection with Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Trypanosoma evansi in mice. IL-12p35(-/-), IL-12p40(-/-), and IL-12p35(-/-)/p40(-/-) mice were susceptible to both pathogens, as was demonstrated by the increased mortality among these mice, compared with wild-type C57BL/6 mice. The different IL-12p70(-/-) mouse strains showed similar mortality kinetics, suggesting that IL-12p70--but not the IL-12p80 homodimer or IL-23--plays a crucial role in survival. Although there were similar plasma levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG2a in IL-12-deficient mice and wild-type mice, interferon (IFN)- gamma production, especially during early infection, was severely impaired in all IL-12p70(-/-) mouse strains, demonstrating an IL-12p70-dependent mechanism for IFN- gamma production. Because IFN- gamma receptor-deficient mice (IFN- gamma R(-/-)) were also highly susceptible to both Trypanosoma species, IL-12p70-dependent IFN- gamma production seems to be the important mechanism involved in resistance against both pathogens."
1423,Activation of endocytosis as an adaptation to the mammalian host by trypanosomes.,"10.1128/EC.00213-07
10.1016/j.protis.2007.07.004",2007-10-02,[],"Immune evasion in African trypanosomes is principally mediated by antigenic variation, but rapid internalization of surface-bound immune factors may contribute to survival. Endocytosis is upregulated approximately 10-fold in bloodstream compared to procyclic forms, and surface coat remodeling accompanies transition between these life stages. Here we examined expression of endocytosis markers in tsetse fly stages in vivo and monitored modulation during transition from bloodstream to procyclic forms in vitro. Among bloodstream stages nonproliferative stumpy forms have endocytic activity similar to that seen with rapidly dividing slender forms, while differentiation of stumpy forms to procyclic forms is accompanied by rapid down-regulation of Rab11 and clathrin, suggesting that modulation of endocytic and recycling systems accompanies this differentiation event. Significantly, rapid down-regulation of endocytic markers occurs upon entering the insect midgut and expression of Rab11 and clathrin remains low throughout subsequent development, which suggests that high endocytic activity is not required for remodeling the parasite surface or for survival within the fly. However, salivary gland metacyclic forms dramatically increase expression of clathrin and Rab11, indicating that emergence of mammalian infective forms is coupled to reacquisition of a high-activity endocytic-recycling system. These data suggest that high-level endocytosis in Trypanosoma brucei is an adaptation required for viability in the mammalian host."
1424,Dihydroxyacetone induced autophagy in African trypanosomes.,10.4161/auto.4907,2007-09-06,[],Dihydroxyacetone (DHA) was examined to explore its trypanocidal activity. The compound is easily taken up by trypanosomes via its aquaglyceroporins but is not converted to a glycolytic intermediate due to the lack of a respective kinase. Investigating the DHA-induced cell death it became evident that parasites die by autophagy rather than by necrosis or apoptosis. Since autophagy is not well studied in African trypanosomes our work offers a way to investigate the importance of autophagy for trypanosomes not only for stress coping but also for organelle reconstruction during differentiation.
1425,Dual role of the RNA substrate in selectivity and catalysis by terminal uridylyl transferases.,10.1073/pnas.0704259104,2007-09-06,[],"Terminal RNA uridylyltransferases (TUTases) catalyze template-independent UMP addition to the 3' hydroxyl of RNA. TUTases belong to the DNA polymerase beta superfamily of nucleotidyltransferases that share a conserved catalytic domain bearing three metal-binding carboxylate residues. We have previously determined crystal structures of the UTP-bound and apo forms of the minimal trypanosomal TUTase, TbTUT4, which is composed solely of the N-terminal catalytic and C-terminal base-recognition domains. Here we report crystal structures of TbTUT4 with bound CTP, GTP, and ATP, demonstrating nearly perfect superposition of the triphosphate moieties with that of the UTP substrate. Consequently, at physiological nucleoside 5'-triphosphate concentrations, the protein-uracil base interactions alone are not sufficient to confer UTP selectivity. To resolve this ambiguity, we determined the crystal structure of a prereaction ternary complex composed of UTP, TbTUT4, and UMP, which mimics an RNA substrate, and the postreaction complex of TbTUT4 with UpU dinucleotide. The UMP pyrimidine ring stacks against the uracil base of the bound UTP, which on its other face also stacks with an essential tyrosine. In contrast, the different orientation of the purine bases observed in cocrystals with ATP and GTP prevents this triple stacking, precluding productive binding of the RNA. The 3' hydroxyl of the bound UMP is poised for in-line nucleophilic attack while contributing to the formation of a binding site for a second catalytic metal ion. We propose a dual role for RNA substrates in TUTase-catalyzed reactions: contribution to selective incorporation of the cognate nucleoside and shaping of the catalytic metal binding site."
1426,Isolation of RNA binding proteins involved in insertion/deletion editing.,10.1016/S0076-6879(07)24004-2,2007-07-31,[],"RNA editing is a collective term referring to a plethora of reactions that ultimately lead to changes in RNA nucleotide sequences apart from splicing, 5' capping, or 3' end processing. In the mitochondria of trypanosomatids, insertion and deletion of uridines must occur, often on a massive scale, in order to generate functional messenger RNAs. The current state of knowledge perceives the editing machinery as a dynamic system, in which heterogeneous protein complexes undergo multiple transient RNA-protein interactions in the course of gRNA processing, gRNA-mRNA recognition, and the cascade of nucleolytic and phosphoryl transfer reactions that ultimately change the mRNA sequence. Identification of RNA binding proteins that interact with the mitochondrial RNAs, core editing complex, or contribute to mRNA stability is of critical importance to our understanding of the editing process. This chapter describes purification and characterization of three RNA binding proteins from kinetoplastid mitochondria that have been genetically demonstrated to affect RNA editing."

These enzymes belong to the DNA polymerase beta superfamily, which also includes poly(A) polymerases, CCA-adding enzymes, and other nucleotidyltransferases. Studies of uridylyl insertion/deletion RNA editing in mitochondria of trypanosomatids provided the first examples of biological functions for TUTases: posttranscriptional uridylylation of guide RNAs by RNA editing TUTase 1 (RET1) and U-insertion mRNA editing by RNA editing TUTase 2 (RET2). The editing TUTases are unified by the presence of conserved catalytic and nucleotide base recognition domains, yet differ substantially in auxiliary function-specific domains, quaternary structure, RNA substrate specificity, and processivity. This chapter describes isolation of TUTases and their complexes from trypanosomatids, methods used for analysis of interactions involving RET1 and RET2, purification of recombinant proteins, and enzyme kinetic assays."
1428,The terminal step in vitamin C biosynthesis in Trypanosoma cruzi is mediated by a FMN-dependent galactonolactone oxidase.,10.1042/BJ20070766,2007-07-14,[],"Humans lack the ability to synthesize vitamin C (ascorbate) due to the absence of gulonolactone oxidase, the last enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway in most other mammals. The corresponding oxidoreductase in trypanosomes therefore represents a target that may be therapeutically exploitable. This is reinforced by our observation that Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, lacks the capacity to scavenge ascorbate from its environment and is therefore dependent on biosynthesis to maintain intracellular levels of this vitamin. Here, we show that T. cruzi galactonolactone oxidase (TcGAL) can utilize both L-galactono-gamma-lactone and D-arabinono-gamma-lactone as substrates for synthesis of vitamin C, in reactions that obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics. It is >20-fold more active than the analogous enzyme from the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei. FMN is an essential cofactor for enzyme activity and binds to TcGAL non-covalently. In other flavoproteins, a histidine residue located within the N-terminal flavin-binding motif has been shown to be crucial for cofactor binding. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that the corresponding residue in TcGAL (Lys-55) is not essential for this interaction. In contrast, we find that histidine and tryptophan residues (His-447 and Trp-448), localized within a C-terminal motif (HWXK) that is a feature of ascorbate-synthesizing enzymes, are necessary for the FMN association. The conserved lysine residue within this motif (Lys-450) is not required for cofactor binding, but its replacement by glycine renders the protein completely inactive."
1430,Allosteric regulation of an essential trypanosome polyamine biosynthetic enzyme by a catalytically dead homolog.,10.1073/pnas.0701111104,2007-05-09,[],"African sleeping sickness is a fatal disease that is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Polyamine biosynthesis is an essential pathway in the parasite and is a validated drug target for treatment of the disease. S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) catalyzes a key step in polyamine biosynthesis. Here, we show that trypanosomatids uniquely contain both a functional AdoMetDC and a paralog designated prozyme that has lost catalytic activity. The T. brucei prozyme forms a high-affinity heterodimer with AdoMetDC that stimulates its activity by 1,200-fold. Both genes are expressed in T. brucei, and analysis of AdoMetDC activity in T. brucei extracts supports the finding that the heterodimer is the functional enzyme in vivo. Thus, prozyme has evolved to be a catalytically dead but allosterically active subunit of AdoMetDC, providing an example of how regulators of multimeric enzymes can evolve through gene duplication and mutational drift. These data identify a distinct mechanism for regulating AdoMetDC in the parasite that suggests new strategies for the development of parasite-specific inhibitors of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway."
1431,The role and characterization of phospholipase A1 in mediating lysophosphatidylcholine synthesis in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1042/BJ20070193,2007-04-04,[],"Lysophospholipids are ubiquitous intermediates in a variety of metabolic and signalling pathways in eukaryotic cells. We have reported recently that lysoglycerophosphatidylcholine (lyso-GPCho) synthesis in the insect form of the ancient eukaryote Trypanosoma brucei is mediated by a novel phospholipase A1 (TbPLA1). In the present study, we show that despite equal levels of TbPLA1 gene expression in wild-type insect and bloodstream trypomastigotes, both TbPLA1 enzyme levels and lysoGPCho metabolites are approx. 3-fold higher in the bloodstream form. Both of these parasite stages synthesize identical molecular species of lysoGPCho. TbPLA1 null mutants in the bloodstream form of the parasite are viable, but are deficient in lysoGPCho synthesis, a defect that can be overcome by the expression of an ectopic copy of TbPLA1. The biochemical attributes of TbPLA1-mediated lysoGPCho synthesis were examined in vitro using recombinant TbPLA1. Although TbPLA1 possesses an active-site serine residue, it is insensitive to serine-modifying reagents, such as di-isopropyl fluorophosphate and PMSF, a characteristic shared by lipases that possess lid-sheltered catalytic triads. TbPLA1 does not require metal co-factors for activity, but it does require interfacial activation prior to catalysis. Results from size-exclusion chromatography and binding kinetics analysis revealed that TbPLA1 activation by Triton X-100/GPCho mixed micelle surfaces was not specific and did not require the pre-formation of a specific enzyme-substrate complex to achieve surface binding."

Another HDL component, haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr), has been suggested as an additional toxin required for full trypanolytic activity of normal human serum. We recently reported the case of a human lacking apoL-I (apoL-I(-/-)HS) as the result of frameshift mutations in both apoL-I alleles. Here, we show that this serum, devoid of any trypanolytic activity, exhibits normal concentrations of HDL-bound Hpr. Conversely, the serum of individuals with normal HDL-bound apoL-I but who lack Hpr and haptoglobin [Hp(r)(-/-)HS] as the result of gene deletion (anhaptoglobinemia) exhibited phenotypically normal but delayed trypanolytic activity. The trypanolytic properties of Hp(r)(-/-)HS were mimicked by free recombinant apoL-I, whereas recombinant Hpr did not affect trypanosomes. The lysis delay observed with either Hp(r)(-/-)HS or recombinant apoL-I could entirely be attributed to a defect in the uptake of the lytic components. Thus, apoL-I is responsible for the trypanolytic activity of normal human serum, whereas Hpr allows fast uptake of the carrier HDL particles, presumably through their binding to an Hp/Hpr surface receptor of the parasite."
1434,"Expression, purification, characterization, and in vivo targeting of trypanosome CTP synthetase for treatment of African sleeping sickness.",10.1074/jbc.M611580200,2007-03-03,[],"African sleeping sickness is a fatal disease caused by two parasite subspecies: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense. We previously reported that trypanosomes have extraordinary low CTP pools compared with mammalian cells. Trypanosomes also lack salvage of cytidine/cytosine making the parasite CTP synthetase a potential target for treatment of the disease. In this study, we have expressed and purified recombinant T. brucei CTP synthetase. The enzyme has a higher K(m) value for UTP than the mammalian CTP synthetase, which in combination with a lower UTP pool may account for the low CTP pool in trypanosomes. The activity of the trypanosome CTP synthetase is irreversibly inhibited by the glutamine analogue acivicin, a drug extensively tested as an antitumor agent. There is a rapid uptake of acivicin in mice both given intraperitoneally and orally by gavage. Daily injection of acivicin in trypanosome-infected mice suppressed the infection up to one month without any significant loss of weight. Experiments with cultured bloodstream T. brucei showed that acivicin is trypanocidal if present at 1 mum concentration for at least 4 days. Therefore, acivicin may qualify as a drug with ""desirable"" properties, i.e. cure within 7 days, according to the current Target Product Profiles of WHO and DNDi."

The most active compound (11a) has low micromolar potency and is structurally diverse from previously reported nucleoside hydrolase inhibitors, which, along with the simplicity of the chemistry involved in its synthesis, makes it a good lead for the further development of novel nucleoside hydrolase inhibitors."

The main cysteine proteases of Trypanosoma cruzi (cruzipain) and of Trypanosoma brucei (brucipain) are validated targets for the development of new chemotherapies. These proteases are synthesized as precursors and activated upon removal of the N-terminal prodomain. Here we report potent and selective inhibition of cruzipain and brucipain by the recombinant full-length prodomain of cruzipain. The propeptide did not inhibit human cathepsins S, K or B or papain at the tested concentrations, and moderately inhibited human cathepsin V. Human cathepsin F was very efficiently inhibited (K(i) of 32 pm), an interesting finding indicating that cruzipain propeptide is able to discriminate cathepsin F from other cathepsin L-like enzymes. Comparative structural modeling and analysis identified the interaction between the beta1p-alpha3p loop of the propeptide and the propeptide-binding loop of mature enzymes as a plausible cause of the observed inhibitory selectivity."
1437,"TcrPDEA1, a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase with atypical pharmacological properties from Trypanosoma cruzi.",10.1016/j.molbiopara.2006.12.002,2007-01-16,[],"Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) catalyze the degradation of cAMP and cGMP, and regulate a variety of cellular processes by controlling the levels of these second messengers. We have previously described the presence of both a calcium-stimulated adenylyl cyclase and two membrane-bound cAMP-specific PDEs (one of them strongly associated to the flagellum and the other one with a possible vesicular localization) in Trypanosoma cruzi. Here we report the identification and characterization of TcrPDEA1, a singular phosphodiesterase of T. cruzi which is resistant to the typical phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as IBMX, papaverine and theofylline. TcrPDEA1 is a single copy gene that encodes a 620-amino acid protein, which is grouped with PDE1 family members, mainly with its kinetoplastid orthologs. TcrPDEA1 was able to complement a mutant yeast strain deficient in PDE genes, demonstrating that this enzyme is a functional phosphodiesterase. TcrPDEA1 is specific for cAMP with a high K(m) value (191.1+/-6.5 microM). Cyclic GMP neither activates the enzyme nor competes as a substrate. In addition, calcium-calmodulin did not affect the kinetic parameters and, as its counterpart in T. brucei, magnesium showed to be crucial for its activity and stability. Although TcrPDEA1 function remains unclear, its presence points out the high complexity of the cAMP signaling in trypanosomatids and the possible compartmentalization of the enzymes involved in the cAMP pathway."
1439,Evidence for U-tail stabilization of gRNA/mRNA interactions in kinetoplastid RNA editing.,10.4161/rna.1.1.898,2006-12-30,[],"The most dramatic example of RNA editing is found in the mitochondria of trypanosomes. In these organisms, U-insertions/deletions can create mRNAs that are twice as large as the gene that encodes them. Guide RNAs (gRNAs) that are complementary to short stretches of the mature message direct the precise placements of the U residues. The binding of gRNA to mRNA is a fundamental step in RNA editing and understanding the relative importance of the elements that confer affinity and specificity on this interaction is critical to our understanding of the editing process. In this study, we have analyzed the relative binding affinities of two different gRNA/mRNA pairs. The affinity of gA6-14 for its message (ATPase 6) is high, with an apparent K(D) in the 5-10 nM range. In contrast, gCYb-558 has a low affinity for its cognate mRNA. Deletion of the gRNA U-tail caused a significant reduction in the binding affinity for only the gCYb-558 pair, and was observed only under physiological magnesium conditions. These results indicate that the U-tail contribution can differ substantially between the different gRNA/mRNA pairs. In addition, our results suggest that the efficiency of gRNA/mRNA interaction is highly dependent on thermodynamic parameters determined by the local sequences and their adopted structures surrounding the anchor-binding site."
1440,UTP-bound and Apo structures of a minimal RNA uridylyltransferase.,10.1016/j.jmb.2006.11.065,2006-12-27,[],"3'-Uridylylation of RNA is emerging as a phylogenetically widespread phenomenon involved in processing events as diverse as uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing in mitochondria of trypanosomes and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation in humans. This reaction is catalyzed by terminal uridylyltransferases (TUTases), which are template-independent RNA nucleotidyltransferases that specifically recognize UTP and belong to a large enzyme superfamily typified by DNA polymerase beta. Multiple TUTases, recently identified in trypanosomes, as well as a U6 snRNA-specific TUTase enzyme in humans, are highly divergent at the protein sequence level. However, they all possess conserved catalytic and UTP recognition domains, often accompanied by various auxiliary modules present at the termini or between conserved domains. Here we report identification, structural and biochemical analyses of a novel trypanosomal TUTase, TbTUT4, which represents a minimal catalytically active RNA uridylyltransferase. The TbTUT4 consists of only two domains that define the catalytic center at the bottom of the nucleoside triphosphate and RNA substrate binding cleft. The 2.0 Angstroms crystal structure reveals two significantly different conformations of this TUTase: one molecule is in a relatively open apo conformation, whereas the other displays a more compact TUTase-UTP complex. A single nucleoside triphosphate is bound in the active site by a complex network of interactions between amino acid residues, a magnesium ion and highly ordered water molecules with the UTP's base, ribose and phosphate moieties. The structure-guided mutagenesis and cross-linking studies define the amino acids essential for catalysis, uracil base recognition, ribose binding and phosphate coordination by uridylyltransferases. In addition, the cluster of positively charged residues involved in RNA binding is identified. We also report a 2.4 Angstroms crystal structure of TbTUT4 with the bound 2' deoxyribonucleoside, which provides the structural basis of the enzyme's preference toward ribonucleotides."
1441,Regulated expression of glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinase in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2006.11.003,2006-12-26,[],"In Trypanosoma brucei, the PGKB and PGKC genes-encoding phosphoglycerate kinase are co-transcribed as part of a polycistronic RNA. PGKB mRNA and the cytosolic PGKB protein are much more abundant in the procyclic life-cycle stage than in bloodstream forms, whereas PGKC mRNA and glycosomal PGKC protein are specific to bloodstream forms. We here show that a sequence between nucleotides 558 and 779 in the 3'-untranslated region of the PGKC mRNA causes low expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in procyclic trypanosomes. In procyclics, depletion of the RRP45 component of the exosome (3'-->5' exonuclease complex) or the 5'-->3' exonuclease XRNA increased the abundance of CAT-PGKC mRNA as a consequence of effects on the degradation of precursor and/or mature mRNAs. In bloodstream forms, inhibition of both trans splicing and transcription resulted in immediate exponential decay of PGKC mRNA with a half-life of 46 min. Inhibition of transcription alone gave non-exponential kinetics and inhibition of splicing alone resulted in a longer apparent half-life. We also found that production of mRNAs using T7 polymerase can affect the apparent half-life, and that large amounts of CAT enzyme may be toxic in trypanosomes."
1442,Novel inhibitors of the trypanosome alternative oxidase inhibit Trypanosoma brucei brucei growth and respiration.,10.1016/j.actatropica.2006.10.005,2006-11-28,[],"African trypanosomiasis is a deadly disease for which few chemotherapeutic options are available. The causative agents, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense, utilize a non-cytochrome, alternative oxidase (AOX) for their cellular respiration. The absence of this enzyme in mammalian cells makes it a logical target for therapeutic agents. We designed three novel compounds, ACB41, ACD15, and ACD16, and investigated their effects on trypanosome alternative oxidase (TAO) enzymatic activity, parasite respiration, and parasite growth in vitro. All three compounds contain a 2-hydroxybenzoic acid moiety, analogous to that present in SHAM, and a prenyl side chain similar to that found in ubiquinol. ACD15 and ACD16 are further differentiated by the presence of a solubility-enhancing carbohydrate moiety. Kinetic studies with purified TAO show that all three compounds competitively inhibit TAO, and two compounds, ACB41 and ACD15, have inhibition constants five- and three-fold more potent than SHAM, respectively. All three compounds inhibited the respiration and growth of continuously cultured T. b. brucei bloodstream cells in a dose-dependent manner. None of the compounds interfered with respiration of rat liver mitochondria, nor did they inhibit the growth of a continuously cultured mammalian cell line. Collectively, the results suggest we have identified a new class of compounds that are inhibitors of TAO, have trypanocidal properties in vitro, and warrant further investigation in vivo."
1444,Trypanothione-dependent glyoxalase I in Trypanosoma cruzi.,10.1042/BJ20060882,2006-09-09,[],"The glyoxalase system, comprizing glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II, is a ubiquitous pathway that detoxifies highly reactive aldehydes, such as methylglyoxal, using glutathione as a cofactor. Recent studies of Leishmania major glyoxalase I and Trypanosoma brucei glyoxalase II have revealed a unique dependence upon the trypanosomatid thiol trypanothione as a cofactor. This difference suggests that the trypanothione-dependent glyoxalase system may be an attractive target for rational drug design against the trypanosomatid parasites. Here we describe the cloning, expression and kinetic characterization of glyoxalase I from Trypanosoma cruzi. Like L. major glyoxalase I, recombinant T. cruzi glyoxalase I showed a preference for nickel as its metal cofactor. In contrast with the L. major enzyme, T. cruzi glyoxalase I was far less fast-idious in its choice of metal cofactor efficiently utilizing cobalt, manganese and zinc. T. cruzi glyoxalase I isomerized hemithio-acetal adducts of trypanothione more than 2400 times more efficiently than glutathione adducts, with the methylglyoxal adducts 2-3-fold better substrates than the equivalent phenylglyoxal adducts. However, glutathionylspermidine hemithioacetal adducts were most efficiently isomerized and the glutathionylspermidine-based inhibitor S-4-bromobenzylglutathionylspermidine was found to be a potent linear competitive inhibitor of the T. cruzi enzyme with a K(i) of 5.4+/-0.6 microM. Prediction algorithms, combined with subcellular fractionation, suggest that T. cruzi glyoxalase I localizes not only to the cytosol but also the mitochondria of T. cruzi epimastigotes. The contrasting substrate specificities of human and trypanosomatid glyoxalase enzymes, confirmed in the present study, suggest that the glyoxalase system may be an attractive target for anti-trypanosomal chemotherapy."
1445,RNAi interference of XPO1 and Sm genes and their effect on the spliced leader RNA in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2006.07.004,2006-08-19,[],"In trypanosomes, trans-splicing is a major essential RNA-processing mechanism that involves the addition of a spliced leader sequence to all mRNAs from a small RNA species, known as the spliced leader RNA (SL RNA). SL RNA maturation is poorly understood and it is not clear where assembly with Sm proteins takes place. In this study, we followed the localization of the SL RNA during knockdown of Sm proteins and XPO1, which in metazoa functions in transport of mRNA and U snRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We found that XPO1 has no role in SL RNA biogenesis in wild-type cells, or when the cells are depleted of Sm proteins. During Sm depletion, 'defective' SL RNA lacking cap modification at position +4 first accumulates in the nucleus, suggesting that Sm assembly on SL RNA most probably takes place in this compartment. Only after massive nuclear accumulation is the 'defective' SL RNA exported to the cytoplasm to form SL RNP-C, which may be a route to dispose of SL RNA when its normal biogenesis is blocked."
1446,Divalent metal requirements for catalysis and stability of the RNA triphosphatase from Trypanosoma cruzi.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2006.06.012,2006-08-05,[],"RNA triphosphatases act in the first step of the mRNA capping process, removing the gamma-phosphoryl group from the 5' end of nascent RNA. A metal-dependent catalysis is found in the enzymes from trypanosomes and several other lower eukaryotes. This contrasts with the cysteine-dependent activity of the corresponding enzymes of mammals, a difference that points to these enzymes as potential targets for drug design. This work describes the identification, expression, purification, enzyme kinetics, and the role of divalent metal in the ATPase activity of the RNA triphosphatase from Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas' disease, and compares it with the previously characterized enzyme from Trypanosoma brucei. Sequence similarity of the T. cruzi enzyme with the RNA triphosphatase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicates that a tunnel domain containing the divalent metal forms its active site. Based on enzyme kinetics, circular dichroism, and intrinsic fluorescence analysis, a kinetic mechanism for the ATPase activity of the T. cruzi tunnel triphosphatase is proposed. A single metal is sufficient to interact with the enzyme through the formation of a productive MnATP-enzyme complex, while free ATP inhibits activity. Manganese is also required for the tunnel stability of the T. cruzi enzyme, while the T. brucei homologue remains stable in the absence of metal, as shown for other triphosphatases. These findings may be useful to devise specific triphosphatase inhibitors to the T. cruzi enzyme."
1447,The glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma cruzi: its role in the defense of the parasite against oxidative stress.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2006.05.009,2006-07-11,[],"The Trypanosoma cruzi glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) is encoded by several genes located in three of the parasite chromosomes. All the sequences present two possible start codons, 111bp apart, also present in its Trypanosoma brucei counterpart. As the 37 residues comprised between the two candidate initiator methionines of T. brucei and T. cruzi G6PDHs constitute an unusual N-terminal extension only present in trypanosomatids, two forms of the T. cruzi G6PDH were expressed in Escherichia coli: a long one (Tc-G6PDH-L) translated from the first ATG codon, and a short one (Tc-G6PDH-S) translated from the second. Both were purified and their kinetic constants determined. The apparent K(m) for glucose-6-phosphate was 189.9, 98.4, and 288microM, for Tc-G6PDH-L, Tc-G6PDH-S and native Tc-G6PDH, respectively. The apparent K(m) for NADP was similar for both recombinant proteins. The Tc-G6PDH-L as well as the native enzyme, was inactivated by DTT while the Tc-G6PDH-S was unaffected by the reducing agent. This behavior could be related to the presence of two Cys groups in the N-terminal extension of the Tc-G6PDH-L similarly to the redox regulated G6PDHs from chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. This property, together with a remarkable induction (up to 46-fold) of the T. cruzi G6PDH in metacyclic trypomastigotes under oxidative stress conditions, suggests that the enzyme may play a prominent role in the defense mechanisms of the parasite against oxidative stress becoming an important target for chemotherapy. Western blots using antibodies against the N-terminal extension in Tc-G6PDH-L show that this form is expressed in the parasite."
1448,"Characterization of a novel cAMP-binding, cAMP-specific cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (TcrPDEB1) from Trypanosoma cruzi.",10.1042/BJ20060757,2006-06-17,[],"Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, encodes a number of different cAMP-specific PDE (phosphodiesterase) families. Here we report the identification and characterization of TcrPDEB1 and its comparison with the previously identified TcrPDEB2 (formerly known as TcPDE1). These are two different PDE enzymes of the TcrPDEB family, named in accordance with the recent recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee for Kinetoplast PDEs [Kunz, Beavo, D'Angelo, Flawia, Francis, Johner, Laxman, Oberholzer, Rascon, Shakur et al. (2006) Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 145, 133-135]. Both enzymes show resistance to inhibition by many mammalian PDE inhibitors, and those that do inhibit do so with appreciable differences in their inhibitor profiles for the two enzymes. Both enzymes contain two GAF (cGMP-specific and -stimulated phosphodiesterases, Anabaena adenylate cyclases and Escherichia coli FhlA) domains and a catalytic domain highly homologous with that of the T. brucei TbPDE2/TbrPDEB2 family. The N-terminus+GAF-A domains of both enzymes showed significant differences in their affinities for cyclic nucleotide binding. Using a calorimetric technique that allows accurate measurements of low-affinity binding sites, the TcrPDEB2 N-terminus+GAF-A domain was found to bind cAMP with an affinity of approximately 500 nM. The TcrPDEB1 N-terminus+GAF-A domain bound cAMP with a slightly lower affinity of approximately 1 muM. The N-terminus+GAF-A domain of TcrPDEB1 did not bind cGMP, whereas the N-terminus+GAF-A domain of TcrPDEB2 bound cGMP with a low affinity of approximately 3 muM. GAF domains homologous with those found in these proteins were also identified in related trypanosomatid parasites. Finally, a fluorescent cAMP analogue, MANT-cAMP [2'-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate], was found to be a substrate for the TcPDEB1 catalytic domain, opening the possibility of using this molecule as a substrate in non-radioactive, fluorescence-based PDE assays, including screening for trypanosome PDE inhibitors."
1449,Accumulation and intracellular distribution of antitrypanosomal diamidine compounds DB75 and DB820 in African trypanosomes.,10.1128/AAC.00192-06,2006-05-26,[],"The aromatic diamidine pentamidine has long been used to treat early-stage human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Two analogs of pentamidine, DB75 and DB820, have been shown to be more potent and less toxic than pentamidine in murine models of trypanosomiasis. The diphenyl furan diamidine, DB75, is the active metabolite of the prodrug DB289, which is currently in phase III clinical trials as a new orally active candidate drug to treat first-stage HAT. The new aza analog, DB820, is the active diamidine of the prodrug DB844, currently undergoing preclinical evaluation as a new candidate to treat HAT of the central nervous system. The exact mechanisms of antitrypanosomal activity of aromatic dications remain poorly understood, with multiple mechanisms hypothesized. Pentamidine is known to be actively transported into trypanosomes and binds to DNA within the nucleus and kinetoplast. A long-hypothesized mechanism of action has been that DNA binding ultimately leads to interference with DNA-associated enzymes. Both DB75 and DB820 are intensely fluorescent, which provides an important tool for determining the kinetics of accumulation and intracellular distribution in trypanosomes. We show in the current study that DB75 and DB820 rapidly accumulate and strongly concentrate within trypanosomes, with intracellular concentrations over 15,000-fold higher than mouse plasma concentrations. Both compounds initially accumulate in the DNA-containing nucleus and kinetoplast, but at later time points, they concentrate in non-DNA-containing cytoplasmic organelles. Analyses of the kinetics of uptake and intracellular distribution are necessary to begin to define antitrypanosomal mechanisms of action of DB75, DB820, and other aromatic diamidines."
1450,Enthalpy versus entropy-driven binding of bisphosphonates to farnesyl diphosphate synthase.,10.1021/ja0601639,2006-03-16,[],"We report the results of an ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry) investigation of the binding of six bisphosphonates to the enzyme farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS; EC 2.5.1.10) from Trypanosoma brucei. The bisphosphonates investigated were zoledronate, risedronate, ibandronate, pamidronate, 2-phenyl-1-hydroxyethane-1,1-bisphosphonate, and 1-(2,2-bisphosphonoethyl)-3-iodo pyridinium. At pH = 7.4, both risedronate and the phenylethane bisphosphonate bind in an enthalpy-driven manner (DeltaH approximately -9 to 10 kcal mol-1), but the other four bisphosphonates bind in an entropy-driven manner (DeltaS varying from 31.2 to 55.1 cal K-1 mol-1). However, at pH = 8.5, zoledronate binding switches from entropy to enthalpy-driven. The DeltaG results are highly correlated with FPPS inhibition results obtained using a radiochemical assay (R2 = 0.85, N = 11, P < 0.001). The DeltaH and DeltaS results are interpreted in terms of a model in which bisphosphonates with charged side chains have positive DeltaH values, due to the enthalpic cost of desolvation (due to strong ion-dipole interactions) and, likewise, a positive DeltaS, due to an increase in water entropy (both ligand and protein associated) on ligand binding to FPPS: the hydrophobic effect. For the neutral side chains (risedronate at pH 7.4, 8.5 and zoledronate at pH 8.5, as well as the phenylethane bisphosphonate), binding is overwhelmingly enthalpy-driven, with the enhanced activity of the basic side chain containing species being attributable to their becoming protonated in the active site. Given the large size of the bisphosphonate market and the potential importance of the development of these compounds for cancer immunotherapy and anti-parasitic chemotherapy, these results are of broad general interest in the context of the development of new, potent, and selective FPPS inhibitors."
1452,Characterization and selective inhibition of myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase from Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major.,10.1042/BJ20051886,2006-02-17,[],"The eukaryotic enzyme NMT (myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase) has been characterized in a range of species from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to Homo sapiens. NMT is essential for viability in a number of human pathogens, including the fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, and the parasitic protozoa Leishmania major and Trypanosoma brucei. We have purified the Leishmania and T. brucei NMTs as active recombinant proteins and carried out kinetic analyses with their essential fatty acid donor, myristoyl-CoA and specific peptide substrates. A number of inhibitory compounds that target NMT in fungal species have been tested against the parasite enzymes in vitro and against live parasites in vivo. Two of these compounds inhibit TbNMT with IC50 values of <1 microM and are also active against mammalian parasite stages, with ED50 (the effective dose that allows 50% cell growth) values of 16-66 microM and low toxicity to murine macrophages. These results suggest that targeting NMT could be a valid approach for the development of chemotherapeutic agents against infectious diseases including African sleeping sickness and Nagana."
1453,Characterization of a Trypanosoma brucei RNA cap (guanine N-7) methyltransferase.,10.1261/rna.2250606,2006-01-25,[],"The m7GpppN cap structure of eukaryotic mRNA is formed by the sequential action of RNA triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and (guanine N-7) methyltransferase. In trypanosomatid protozoa, the m7GpppN is further modified by seven methylation steps within the first four transcribed nucleosides to form the cap 4 structure. The RNA triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase components have been characterized in Trypanosoma brucei. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a T. brucei (guanine N-7) methyltransferase (TbCmt1). Sequence alignment of the 324-amino acid TbCmt1 with the corresponding enzymes from human (Hcm1), fungal (Abd1), and microsporidian (Ecm1) revealed the presence of conserved residues known to be essential for methyltransferase activity. Purified recombinant TbCmt1 catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the N-7 position of the cap guanine in GpppN-terminated RNA to form the m7GpppN cap. TbCmt1 also methylates GpppG and GpppA but not GTP or dGTP. Mutational analysis of individual residues of TbCmt1 that were predicted-on the basis of the crystal structure of Ecm1--to be located at or near the active site identified six conserved residues in the putative AdoMet- or cap-binding pocket that caused significant reductions in TbCmt1 methyltransferase activity. We also report the identification of a second T. brucei RNA (guanine N-7) cap methyltransferase (named TbCgm1). The 1050-amino acid TbCgm1 consists of a C-terminal (guanine N-7) methyltransferase domain, which is homologous with TbCmt1, and an N-terminal guanylyltransferase domain, which contains signature motifs found in the nucleotidyl transferase superfamily."
1454,Time-dependent inhibitors of trypanothione reductase: analogues of the spermidine alkaloid lunarine and related natural products.,10.1016/j.bmc.2005.11.004,2005-11-24,[],"The macrocyclic spermidine alkaloid lunarine 1 from Lunaria biennis is a competitive, time-dependent inhibitor of the protozoan oxidoreductase trypanothione reductase (TryR), a promising target in drug design against tropical parasitic diseases. Various molecules related to 1 and the alkaloid itself have been synthesized in racemic form and evaluated against TryR in order to determine the key features of 1 that are associated with time-dependent inhibition. Kinetic data are consistent with an inactivation mechanism involving a conjugate addition of an active site cysteine residue onto the C-24-C-25 double bond of the tricyclic nucleus of 1. Comparison of data for synthetic (+/-)-1, the natural product, and other derivatives 7-10 from L. biennis confirms the importance of the unique structure of the tricyclic core as a motif for inhibitor design and reveals that the non-natural enantiomer may be a more suitable scaffold upon which thiophilic groups may be presented."
1456,Purine nucleobase transport in amastigotes of Leishmania mexicana: involvement in allopurinol uptake.,10.1128/AAC.49.9.3682-3689.2005,2005-08-30,[],"Nucleobase and nucleoside transporters play central roles in the biochemistry of parasitic protozoa, as they lack the ability to synthesize purines de novo and are absolutely reliant upon purine salvage from their hosts. Furthermore, such transporters are potentially critical to the pharmacology of these important human pathogens, because they mediate the uptake of purine analogues, as well as some nonpurine drugs, that can be selectively cytotoxic to the parasites. We here report the first identification and characterization of a purine nucleobase transporter in Leishmania amastigotes. Uptake of [3H]hypoxanthine by Leishmania mexicana amastigotes was mediated by a single high-affinity transporter, LmexNBT1, with a Km of 1.6 +/- 0.4 microM and high affinity for adenine, guanine, and xanthine but low affinity for nucleosides and pyrimidine nucleobases. Allopurinol, an antileishmanial hypoxanthine analogue, was apparently taken up by the same transporter. Using [3H]allopurinol, a Km value of 33.6 +/- 6.0 microM was obtained. All evidence was compatible with a model of a single purine nucleobase transporter being expressed in amastigotes. Using various purine nucleobase analogues, a model for the interactions between hypoxanthine and the transporter's permeant binding site was constructed. The binding interactions were compared with those of the LmajNBT1 transporter in Leishmania major promastigotes and found to be very similar."
1457,Vitamin C biosynthesis in trypanosomes: a role for the glycosome.,10.1073/pnas.0504251102,2005-08-10,[],"The capacity to synthesize vitamin C (ascorbate) is widespread in eukaryotes but is absent from humans. The last step in the biosynthetic pathway involves the conversion of an aldonolactone substrate to ascorbate, a reaction catalyzed by members of an FAD-dependent family of oxidoreductases. Here we demonstrate that both the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, and the American trypanosome, Trypanosoma cruzi, have the capacity to synthesize vitamin C and show that this reaction occurs in a unique single-membrane organelle, the glycosome. The corresponding T. brucei flavoprotein (TbALO) obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics and can utilize both L-galactono-gamma-lactone and D-arabinono-gamma-lactone as substrate, properties characteristic of plant and fungal enzymes. We could detect no activity toward the mammalian enzyme substrate L-gulono-gamma-lactone. TbALO null mutants (bloodstream form) were found to display a transient growth defect, a trait that was enhanced when they were cultured in medium in which the essential serum component had been pretreated with ascorbate oxidase to deplete vitamin C. It is implicit, therefore, that bloodstream-form trypanosomes also possess a capacity for ascorbate transport."
1460,Structural and mutational analysis of Trypanosoma brucei prostaglandin H2 reductase provides insight into the catalytic mechanism of aldo-ketoreductases.,10.1074/jbc.M413884200,2005-04-23,[],"Trypanosoma brucei prostaglandin F2alpha synthase is an aldo-ketoreductase that catalyzes the reduction of prostaglandin H2 to PGF2alpha in addition to that of 9,10-phenanthrenequinone. We report the crystal structure of TbPGFS.NADP+.citrate at 2.1 angstroms resolution. TbPGFS adopts a parallel (alpha/beta)8-barrel fold lacking the protrudent loops and possesses a hydrophobic core active site that contains a catalytic tetrad of tyrosine, lysine, histidine, and aspartate, which is highly conserved among AKRs. Site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic tetrad residues revealed that a dyad of Lys77 and His110, and a triad of Tyr52, Lys77, and His110 are essential for the reduction of PGH2 and 9,10-PQ, respectively. Structural and kinetic analysis revealed that His110, acts as the general acid catalyst for PGH2 reduction and that Lys77 facilitates His110 protonation through a water molecule, while exerting an electrostatic repulsion against His110 that maintains the spatial arrangement which allows the formation of a hydrogen bond between His110 and C11 that carbonyl of PGH2. We also show Tyr52 acts as the general acid catalyst for 9,10-PQ reduction, and thus we not only elucidate the catalytic mechanism of a PGH2 reductase but also provide an insight into the catalytic specificity of AKRs."
1461,"Substrate specificity, localization, and essential role of the glutathione peroxidase-type tryparedoxin peroxidases in Trypanosoma brucei.",10.1074/jbc.M413338200,2005-01-25,[],"Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, encodes three nearly identical cysteine homologues of the classical selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidases. Although one of the sequences, peroxidase III, carries both putative mitochondrial and glycosomal targeting signals, the proteins are detectable only in the cytosol and mitochondrion of mammalian bloodstream and insect procyclic T. brucei. The enzyme is a trypanothione/tryparedoxin peroxidase as are the 2 Cys-peroxiredoxins of the parasite. Hydrogen peroxide, thymine hydroperoxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide are reduced with second order rate constants of 8.7 x 10(4), 7.6 x 10(4), and 4 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1), respectively, and represent probable physiological substrates. Phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide is a very weak substrate and, in the absence of Triton X-100, even an inhibitor of the enzyme. The substrate preference clearly contrasts with that of the closely related T. cruzi enzyme, which reduces phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides but not H(2)O(2). RNA interference causes severe growth defects in bloodstream and procyclic cells in accordance with the peroxidases being essential in both developmental stages. Thus, the cellular functions of the glutathione peroxidase-type enzymes cannot be taken over by the 2 Cys-peroxiredoxins that also occur in the cytosol and mitochondrion of the parasite."
1463,Trypanothione biosynthesis in Leishmania major.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2004.10.004,2004-12-22,[],"Trypanothione plays a crucial role in regulation of intracellular thiol redox balance and in defence against chemical and oxidant stress. Crithidia fasciculata requires two enzymes for the formation of trypanothione, namely glutathionylspermidine synthetase (GspS; EC 6.3.1.8) and a glutathionylspermidine-dependent trypanothione synthetase (TryS; EC 6.3.1.9), whereas Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei use a broad-specificity trypanothione synthetase to make trypanothione from glutathione (GSH) and spermidine. Here, we report the identification of two genes in Leishmania major with similarity to previously identified GSPS and TRYS. GSPS is an apparent pseudogene containing two frame shift mutations and two stop codons, whereas TRYS is in a single open-reading frame. The enzyme encoded by TRYS was expressed and found to catalyse formation of trypanothione with GSH and either spermidine or glutathionylspermidine. When GSH is varied as substrate the enzyme displays substrate inhibition (apparent Km=89 microM, Ki(s)=1mM, k(cat)=2s-1). At a fixed GSH concentration, the enzyme obeys simple hyperbolic kinetics with the other substrates with apparent Km values for spermidine, glutathionylspermidine and MgATP of 940, 40 and 63 microM, respectively. Immunofluorescence and sub-cellular fractionation studies indicate that TryS localises to the cytosol of L. major promastigotes. Phylogenetic analysis of the GspS and TryS amino acid sequences suggest that in the trypanosomatids, TryS has evolved to replace the GspS/TryS complex in C. fasciculata. It also appears that the L. major still harbours a redundant GSPS pseudogene that may be currently in the process of being lost from its genome."
1464,Selective transport of a new class of purine antimetabolites by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1081/NCN-200027660,2004-12-02,[],Purine antimetabolites have been very successful therapeutic agents against a host of infectious diseases and malignancies. Success of the treatment relies as much on the efficient accumulation by the target cell or organism as it does on selective action on a vital biochemical pathway of the target cell. Here we compare the ability of a new class of tricyclic purine antimetabolites to interact with transporters from human erythrocytes or Trypanosoma brucei. We show that these compounds display a remarkable selectivity for the parasite's transporters. The adenine analogue showed greater trypanocidal activity than the hypoxanthine or guanine analogues in vitro.
1465,"Human infectivity trait in Trypanosoma brucei: stability, heritability and relationship to sra expression.",10.1017/s0031182004005906,2004-11-04,[],"Some Trypanosoma brucei lines infect humans whereas others do not because the parasites are lysed by human serum. We have developed a robust, quantitative in vitro assay based on differential uptake of fluorescent dyes by live and dead trypanosomes to quantify the extent and kinetics of killing by human serum. This method has been used to discriminate between 3 classes of human serum resistance; sensitive, resistant and intermediate. TREU 927/4, the parasite used for the T. brucei genome project, is intermediate. The phenotype is expressed in both bloodstream and metacyclic forms, is stably expressed during chronic infections and on cyclical transmission through tsetse flies. Trypanosomes of intermediate phenotype are distinguished from sensitive populations of cells by the slower rate of lysis and by the potential to become fully resistant to killing by human serum as a result of selection or long-term serial passaging in mice, and to pass on full resistance phenotype to its progeny in a genetic cross. The sra gene has been shown previously to determine human serum resistance in T. brucei but screening for the presence and expression of this gene indicated that it is not responsible for the human serum resistance phenotype in the trypanosome lines that we have examined, indicating that an alternative mechanism for HSR exists in these stocks. Examination of the inheritance of the phenotype in F1 hybrids for both bloodstream and metacyclic stages from 2 genetic crosses demonstrated that the phenotype is co-inherited in both life-cycle stages in a manner consistent with being a Mendelian trait, determined by only one or a few genes."
1466,Both of the Rab5 subfamily small GTPases of Trypanosoma brucei are essential and required for endocytosis.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2004.07.007,2004-10-27,[],"Endocytosis is an essential process in Trypanosoma brucei and all evidence suggests it is exclusively clathrin-mediated. The trypanosome genome encodes two Rab5 proteins, small GTPases that play a role in very early stages of endocytosis. In the mammalian bloodstream stage TbRAB5A localises to compartments containing internalised antibody, variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) and transferrin, whilst TbRAB5B localises to compartments containing the transmembrane protein ISG(100). Dominant-active forms of TbRAB5A stimulate endocytosis in procyclic forms and alter the kinetics of anti-VSG antibody and transferrin turnover in bloodstream stages. Similar mutants of TbRAB5B increase fluid phase uptake in procyclic cells but do not significantly affect endocytosis in bloodstream forms. Here, we use RNA interference to evaluate the relative importance of TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B and show that both GTPases are essential in the bloodstream form. Depletion of either TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B results in morphological abnormalities, including enlargement of the flagellar pocket, consistent with a potent block to endocytosis. Also, RNAi compromises transferrin accumulation in both cases but induces distinct patterns of mislocalisation of endosomal markers. Finally, RNAi of either TbRAB5A or TbRAB5B results in a decrease in levels of clathrin. Taken together, these data indicate that both TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B are required for endocytosis in trypanosomes and demonstrate that there are multiple essential endocytic routes in this organism."
1467,A novel purine nucleoside transporter whose expression is up-regulated in the short stumpy form of the Trypanosoma brucei life cycle.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2004.04.009,2004-10-14,[],"Purine nucleoside and nucleobase transporters play a vital role in the metabolism and survival of Trypanosoma brucei because this parasitic protozoan is unable to synthesize purines de novo and thus must acquire preformed purines from its hosts. These parasites express a variety of nucleoside and nucleobase permeases with diverse substrate specificities and distinct patterns of expression during the trypanosome life cycle. We report here that expression of the newly characterized T. brucei nucleoside transporter 10 gene (TbNT10) is up-regulated in the short stumpy form of the life cycle, the bloodstream form of the parasite that is pre-adapted for infection of the tsetse fly vector. Functional expression of TbNT10 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that the TbNT10 gene encodes an adenosine/guanosine/inosine transporter with apparent Km values of approximately 1 microM and hence is a high affinity purine nucleoside transporter. The restricted expression of TbNT10 during the life cycle suggests that the functional properties of this permease may be specialized to support development and growth of the differentiated short stumpy form or to promote the transformation of short stumpy to procyclic forms within the insect vector."
1468,Multiple active site conformations revealed by distant site mutation in ornithine decarboxylase.,10.1021/bi048933l,2004-10-13,[],"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is an obligate homodimer that catalyzes the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent decarboxylation of l-ornithine to putrescine, a vital step in polyamine biosynthesis. A previous mutagenic analysis of the ODC dimer interface identified several residues that were distant from the active site yet had a greater impact on catalytic activity than on dimer stability [Myers, D. P., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 13230-13236]. To better understand the basis of this phenomenon, the structure of the Trypanosoma brucei ODC mutant K294A was determined to 2.15 A resolution in complex with the substrate analogue d-ornithine. This residue is distant from the reactive center (>10 A from the PLP Schiff base), and its mutation reduced catalytic efficiency by 3 kcal/mol. The X-ray structure demonstrates that the mutation increases the disorder of residues Leu-166-Ala-172 (Lys-169 loop), which normally form interactions with Lys-294 across the dimer interface. In turn, the Lys-169 loop forms interactions with the active site, suggesting that the reduced catalytic efficiency is mediated by the decreased stability of this loop. The extent of disorder varies in the four Lys-169 loops in the asymmetric unit, suggesting that the mutation has led to an increase in the population of inactive conformations. The structure also reveals that the mutation has affected the nature of the ligand-bound species. Each of the four active sites contains unusual ligands. The electron density suggests one active site contains a gem-diamine intermediate with d-ornithine; the second has density consistent with a tetrahedral adduct with glycine, and the remaining two contain tetrahedral adducts of PLP, Lys-69, and water (or hydroxide). These data also suggest that the structure is less constrained in the mutant enzyme. The observation of a gem-diamine intermediate provides insight into the conformational changes that occur during the ODC catalytic cycle."
1469,Cytoplasmic targeting signals in transmembrane invariant surface glycoproteins of trypanosomes.,10.1074/jbc.M409311200,2004-09-03,[],"Protein targeting mechanisms in flagellated protozoan parasites have received considerable interest because of a huge bias in these organisms toward the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor as a mechanism for the membrane attachment of cell surface macromolecules. In this study, the trafficking of invariant surface glycoprotein 65 (ISG65), a family of type I transmembrane proteins, was examined. Analysis of the C-terminal domains of ISG65 family members demonstrated a high level of conservation and, in particular, the presence of three lysine residues contained within the cytoplasmic tails of all ISG65s. ISG65 was expressed on the cell surface, in agreement with earlier work, but an intracellular pool of ISG65 was also detected within a Rab5A early endosome. Transplantation of the C-terminal 74 amino acids of ISG65 (encompassing the 23 C-terminal residues of the extracellular domain, the transmembrane peptide, and the cytoplasmic domain) onto the N-terminal domain of BiP (BiPN) was sufficient to target the chimera to the same internal compartments as native ISG65. Further, site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the cytoplasmic tail was required for endoplasmic reticulum exit and that at least two of the cytoplasmic domain lysine residues are needed for endosomal targeting, as removal of all three led to surface expression. Kinetic measurements demonstrate that the BiPN fusion protein (containing the ISG65 C terminus) has a short half-life, indicating rapid turnover. In contrast, BiPN fusion proteins containing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor instead of the ISG65 C-terminal region are stably expressed on the surface, confirming the requirement for the ISG65 sequence for endosomal targeting. We suggest that the lack of surface expression of the BiPN-ISG65 fusion protein is likely due to more efficient internalization compared with ISG65. Taken together, these data demonstrate the presence of a lysine-dependent endocytosis signal in the ISG65 family."
1471,Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus-1 encodes an unusual arginine decarboxylase that is a close homolog of eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylases.,10.1074/jbc.M405366200,2004-06-11,[],"Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus (PBCV-1) is a large double-stranded DNA virus that infects chlorella-like green algae. The virus encodes a homolog of eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) that was previously demonstrated to be capable of decarboxylating l-ornithine. However, the active site of this enzyme contains a key amino acid substitution (Glu for Asp) of a residue that interacts with the delta-amino group of ornithine analogs in the x-ray structures of ODC. To determine whether this active-site change affects substrate specificity, kinetic analysis of the PBCV-1 decarboxylase (PBCV-1 DC) on three basic amino acids was undertaken. The k(cat)/K(m) for l-arginine is 550-fold higher than for either l-ornithine or l-lysine, which were decarboxylated with similar efficiency. In addition, alpha-difluoromethylarginine was a more potent inhibitor of the enzyme than alpha-difluoromethylornithine. Mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that inactivation was consistent with the formation of a covalent adduct at Cys(347). These data demonstrate that PBCV-1 DC should be reclassified as an arginine decarboxylase. The eukaryotic ODCs, as well as PBCV-1 DC, are only distantly related to the bacterial and plant arginine decarboxylases from their common beta/alpha-fold class; thus, the finding that PBCV-1 DC prefers l-arginine to l-ornithine was unexpected based on evolutionary analysis. Mutational analysis was carried out to determine whether the Asp-to-Glu substitution at position 296 (position 332 in Trypanosoma brucei ODC) conferred the change in substrate specificity. This residue was found to be an important determinant of substrate binding for both l-arginine and l-ornithine, but it is not sufficient to encode the change in substrate preference."

These proteins, named tcZFP1 and tcZFP2, share the unusual zinc finger motif (CCCH) found in a diverse range of RNA-binding proteins involved in various aspects of the control of cell homeostasis and differentiation.

1473,Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi tryparedoxin peroxidases catalytically detoxify peroxynitrite via oxidation of fast reacting thiols.,10.1074/jbc.M404317200,2004-05-25,[],"Macrophage activation is one of the hallmarks observed in trypanosomiasis, and the parasites must cope with the resulting oxidative burden, which includes the production of peroxynitrite, an unusual peroxo-acid that acts as a strong oxidant and trypanocidal molecule. Cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidase (cTXNPx) has been recently identified as essential for oxidative defense in trypanosomatids. This peroxiredoxin decomposes peroxides using tryparedoxin (TXN) as electron donor, which in turn is reduced by dihydrotrypanothione. In this work, we studied the kinetics of the reaction of peroxynitrite with the different thiol-containing components of the cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidase system in T. brucei (Tb) and T. cruzi (Tc), namely trypanothione, TXN, and cTXNPx. We found that whereas peroxynitrite reacted with dihydrotrypanothione and TbTXN at moderate rates (7200 and 3500 m(-1) s(-1), respectively, at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C) and within the range of typical thiols, the second order rate constants for the reaction of peroxynitrite with reduced TbcTXNPx and TccTXNPx were 9 x 10(5) and 7.2 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1) at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C, respectively. This reactivity was dependent on a highly reactive cTXNPx thiol group identified as cysteine 52. Competition experiments showed that TbcTXNPx inhibited other fast peroxynitrite-mediated processes, such as the oxidation of Mn(3+)-porphyrins. Moreover, steady-state kinetic studies indicate that peroxynitrite-dependent TbcTXNPx and TccTXNPx oxidation is readily reverted by TXN, supporting that these peroxiredoxins would be not only a preferential target for peroxynitrite reactivity but also be able to act catalytically in peroxynitrite decomposition in vivo."
1474,Plasma kinetics and efficacy of oral megazol treatment in Trypanosoma brucei brucei-infected sheep.,10.1016/j.vetpar.2004.02.027,2004-05-12,[],"Experimentally infected sheep have been previously developed as an animal model of trypanosomosis. We used this model to test the efficacy of megazol on eleven Trypanosoma brucei brucei-infected sheep. When parasites were found in blood on day 11 post-infection, megazol was orally administered at a single dose of 40 or 80mg/kg. After a transient aparasitaemic period, all animals except two relapsed starting at day 2 post-treatment, which were considerated as cured on day 150 post-treatment and showed no relapse after a follow-up period of 270 days. In order to understand the high failure of megazol treatment to cure animals, a kinetic study was carried out. Plasma concentrations of megazol determined, by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography at 8h post-treatment in these animals, were lowered, suggesting slow megazol absorption, except in cured animals. However, megazol plasma profiles in uninfected sheep after a single oral dose of megazol showed a fast megazol lowered absorption associated with a short plasma half-life of drug. Inter-individual variation of megazol pharmacokinetic properties was also observed. These findings suggested that the high failure rates of megazol treatment were related to poor drug availability after oral administration in sheep. In conclusion, megazol could cure sheep with T. b. brucei infection but oral administration was not an effective route."
1475,Mouse strain susceptibility to trypanosome infection: an arginase-dependent effect.,10.4049/jimmunol.172.10.6298,2004-05-07,[],"We previously reported that macrophage arginase inhibits NO-dependent trypanosome killing in vitro and in vivo. BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice are known to be susceptible and resistant to trypanosome infection, respectively. Hence, we assessed the expression and the role of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and arginase in these two mouse strains infected with Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Arginase I and arginase II mRNA expression was higher in macrophages from infected BALB/c compared with those from C57BL/6 mice, whereas iNOS mRNA was up-regulated at the same level in both phenotypes. Similarly, arginase activity was more important in macrophages from infected BALB/c vs infected C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, increase of arginase I and arginase II mRNA levels and of macrophage arginase activity was directly induced by trypanosomes, with a higher level in BALB/c compared with C57BL/6 mice. Neither iNOS expression nor NO production was stimulated by trypanosomes in vitro. The high level of arginase activity in T. brucei brucei-infected BALB/c macrophages strongly inhibited macrophage NO production, which in turn resulted in less trypanosome killing compared with C57BL/6 macrophages. NO generation and parasite killing were restored to the same level in BALB/c and C57BL/6 macrophages when arginase was specifically inhibited with N(omega)-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine. In conclusion, host arginase represents a marker of resistance/susceptibility to trypanosome infections."
1476,The trypanocide diminazene aceturate is accumulated predominantly through the TbAT1 purine transporter: additional insights on diamidine resistance in african trypanosomes.,10.1128/AAC.48.5.1515-1519.2004,2004-04-24,[],"Resistance to diminazene aceturate (Berenil) is a severe problem in the control of African trypanosomiasis in domestic animals. It has been speculated that resistance may be the result of reduced diminazene uptake by the parasite. We describe here the mechanisms by which [(3)H]diminazene is transported by Trypanosoma brucei brucei bloodstream forms. Diminazene was rapidly accumulated through a single transporter, with a K(m) of 0.45 +/- 0.11 micro M, which was dose dependently inhibited by pentamidine and adenosine. The K(i) values for these inhibitors were consistent with this transporter being the P2/TbAT1 adenosine transporter. Yeast expressing TbAT1 acquired the ability to take up [(3)H]diminazene and [(3)H]pentamidine. TbAT1-null mutants had lost almost all capacity for [(3)H]diminazene transport. However, this cell line still displayed a small but detectable rate of [(3)H]diminazene accumulation, in a nonsaturable manner. We conclude that TbAT1 mediates [(3)H]diminazene transport almost exclusively and that this explains the observed diminazene resistance phenotypes of TbAT1-null mutants and field isolates."
1477,Mathematical and statistical analysis of the Trypanosoma brucei slender to stumpy transition.,10.1017/s0031182003004256,2004-03-09,[],"We propose a new model for the Stumpy Induction Factor-induced slender to stumpy transformation of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense cells in immunosuppressed mice. The model is a set of delay differential equations that describe the time-course of the infection. We fit the model, using a maximum-likelihood method, to previously published data on parasitaemia in four mice. The model is shown to be a good fit and parameter estimates and confidence intervals are derived. Our estimated parameter values are consistent with estimates from previous experimental studies. The model predicts the following. Slender cells can be classified as uncommitted, committed and dividing, and committed and non-dividing. A committed slender cell undergoes about 5 divisions before exiting the cell-cycle. Committed slender cells must produce SIF, and stumpy cells must not produce SIF. There are two mechanisms for differentiation, a background differentiation rate, and a SIF-concentration-dependent differentiation rate, which is proportional to SIF concentration. SIF has a half-life of about 1.4 h in mice. We also show, with suitable changes in the parameter values, that the model reflects behaviours seen in other host species and trypanosome strains."
1478,Kinetics of endocytosis and recycling of the GPI-anchored variant surface glycoprotein in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1242/jcs.00938,2004-03-05,[],"The dense coat of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) covering parasitic African trypanosomes is essential for survival in mammalian hosts. VSG is internalised and recycled exclusively via a specialised part of the plasma membrane, the flagellar pocket. Direct measurement of the kinetics of VSG endocytosis and recycling shows that the VSG cell-surface pool is turned over within 12 minutes. Correspondingly, the turnover of the intracellular pool (9+/-4% of total VSG) requires only 1 minute, and this is an exceptionally high rate considering that endocytosis and exocytosis are limited to only 5% of the cell surface area. Kinetic 3D co-localisation analysis using biotinylated VSG and a panel of compartmental markers provides consistent evidence for the itinerary of VSG through the cell: VSG is endocytosed in large clathrin-coated vesicles, which bud from the flagellar pocket membrane at a rate of 6-7 vesicles per second, and is then delivered to RAB5-positive early endosomes. From there, VSG is recycled to RAB11-positive recycling endosomes at two stages, either directly or via RAB7-positive, late endosomes. Small clathrin-coated vesicles carrying fluid-phase cargo and being depleted of VSG bud from early and recycling endosomes. These vesicles are postulated to deliver their content to late endosomes and/or the lysosome. The recycling endosomes give rise to RAB11-positive exocytic carriers that fuse with the flagellar pocket and thereby return VSG to the cell surface. VSG recycling provides an interesting model for studies on the cellular trafficking and sorting of GPI-anchored proteins."

In humans, 11 different PDE families have been identified to date, all of which belong to the class I PDEs. Pharmacologically, they have become of great interest as targets for the development of drugs for a large variety of clinical conditions. PDEs in parasitic protozoa have not yet been extensively investigated, despite their potential as antiparasitic drug targets. The current study presents the identification and characterization of a novel class I PDE from the parasitic protozoon Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human sleeping sickness. This enzyme, TbPDE1, is encoded by a single-copy gene located on chromosome 10, and it functionally complements PDE-deficient strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Its C-terminal catalytic domain shares about 30% amino acid identity, including all functionally important residues, with the catalytic domains of human PDEs. A fragment of TbPDE1 containing the catalytic domain could be expressed in active form in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme is specific for cAMP, but exhibits a remarkably high Km of > 600 microm for this substrate."
1481,The 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma cruzi: the absence of two inter-subunit salt bridges as a reason for enzyme instability.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2003.10.007,2003-12-31,[],"The third enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), is present in the four major stages of Trypanosoma cruzi, CL Brener clone. The enzyme was too unstable to be purified from epimastigote cell-free extracts. Two genes encoding 6PGDH were cloned and sequenced; the predicted amino acid sequences differ only in five non-essential residues. Since Southern blots suggested the presence of a single copy per haploid genome, the two genes found are probably alleles. One of these genes, encoding a protein with 78.6% identity with the Trypanosoma brucei 6PGDH, was expressed in Escherichia coli as an active recombinant enzyme, which was as unstable as the native 6PGDH. Modeling of the T. cruzi enzyme using the three-dimensional structure of the T. brucei 6PGDH as template suggested the lack of two out of five salt bridges proposed to strengthen subunit interactions in the active dimer. Restoring of these bridges by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in a more stable recombinant T. cruzi 6PGDH, which was used to determine the kinetic parameters. The K(m) value for 6-phosphogluconate (22.2+/-0.4 microM) was identical to the values reported for 6PGDHs from mammals, but the K(m) for NADP (5.9+/-0.2 microM) was significantly lower than the value reported for the human enzyme, and closer to that for the T. brucei enzyme. This suggests the possibility that inhibitors of the T. brucei 6PGDH, under development as potential drugs against African Trypanosomiasis, might also be successful for the chemotherapy of Chagas disease."

In most organisms, the pathway of GPI biosynthesis involves inositol acylation and inositol deacylation as discrete steps at the beginning and end of the pathway, respectively. The bloodstream form of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is unusual in that these reactions occur on multiple GPI intermediates and that it can express side chains of up to six galactose residues on its mature GPI anchors. An inositol deacylase gene, T. brucei GPIdeAc, has been identified. A null mutant was created and shown to be capable of expressing normal mature GPI anchors on its variant surface glycoprotein. Here, we show that the null mutant synthesizes galactosylated forms of the mature GPI precursor, glycolipid A, at an accelerated rate (2.8-fold compared to wild type). These free GPIs accumulate at the cell surface as metabolic end products. Using continuous and pulse-chase labeling experiments, we show that there are two pools of glycolipid A. Only one pool is competent for transfer to nascent variant surface glycoprotein and represents 38% of glycolipid A in wild-type cells. This pool rises to 75% of glycolipid A in the GPIdeAc null mutant. We present a model for the pathway of GPI biosynthesis in T. brucei that helps to explain the complex phenotype of the GPIdeAc null mutant."
1483,A role for the exosome in the in vivo degradation of unstable mRNAs.,10.1261/rna.5940703,2003-11-19,[],"In mammals, the mRNAs encoding many proteins involved in inflammation bear destabilizing AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3'-untranslated region. The exosome, a complex of 3' --> 5' exonucleases, is rate limiting in the destruction of such mRNAs in a mammalian in vitro system, but a role in vivo has not been demonstrated. The phenomenon of ARE-mediated degradation also occurs in the protist parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Messenger RNAs with 3'-untranslated region U-rich elements, which strongly resemble AREs, are extremely unstable in the trypanosome form that parasitizes mammals. The first step in degradation of these mRNAs in vivo is rapid destruction of the 3'-untranslated region; subsequently the mRNA is destroyed by exonucleases acting in both 5' --> 3' and 3' --> 5' directions. We here investigated the roles of three subunits of the trypanosome exosome complex, RRP45, RRP4, and CSL4, in this process, depleting the individual subunits in vivo by inducible RNA interference. RRP45 depletion, which probably disrupts exosome integrity, caused a delay in the onset of degradation of the very unstable RNAs, but did not affect degradation of more stable species. Depletion of RRP4 or CSL4 does not affect the stability of the residual exosome and did not change mRNA degradation kinetics. We conclude that the exosome is required for the initiation of rapid degradation of unstable mRNAs in trypanosomes."
1484,"Crystal structure of Trypanosoma cruzi glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase complexed with an analogue of 1,3-bisphospho-d-glyceric acid.",10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03857.x,2003-11-19,[],"We report here the first crystal structure of a stable isosteric analogue of 1,3-bisphospho-d-glyceric acid (1,3-BPGA) bound to the catalytic domain of Trypanosoma cruzi glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) in which the two phosphoryl moieties interact with Arg249. This complex possibly illustrates a step of the catalytic process by which Arg249 may induce compression of the product formed, allowing its expulsion from the active site. Structural modifications were introduced into this isosteric analogue and the respective inhibitory effects of the resulting diphosphorylated compounds on T. cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei gGAPDHs were investigated by enzymatic inhibition studies, fluorescence spectroscopy, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular modelling. Despite the high homology between the two trypanomastid gGAPDHs (> 95%), we have identified specific interactions that could be used to design selective irreversible inhibitors against T. cruzi gGAPDH."
1485,A pyrophosphatase regulating polyphosphate metabolism in acidocalcisomes is essential for Trypanosoma brucei virulence in mice.,10.1074/jbc.M309974200,2003-11-15,[],"We report the functional characterization of a soluble pyrophosphatase (TbVSP1), which localizes to acidocalcisomes, a vesicular acidic compartment of Trypanosoma brucei. Depending on the pH and the cofactors Mg(2+) or Zn(2+), both present in the compartment, the enzyme hydrolyzes either inorganic pyrophosphate (PP(i)) (k(cat) = 385 s(-1)) or tripolyP (polyP(3)) and polyphosphate (polyP) of 28 residues (polyP(28)) with k(cat) values of 52 and 3.5 s(-1), respectively. An unusual N-terminal domain of 160 amino acids, containing a putative calcium EF-hand-binding domain, is involved in protein oligomerization. Using double-stranded RNA interference methodology, we produced an inducible bloodstream form (BF) deficient in the TbVSP1 protein (BFiVSP1). The long-chain polyP levels of these mutants were reduced by 60%. Their phenotypes revealed a deficient polyP metabolism, as indicated by their defective response to phosphate starvation and hyposmotic stress. BFiVSP1 did not cause acute virulent infection in mice, demonstrating that TbVSP1 is essential for growth of bloodstream forms in the mammalian host."
1486,Cloning and analysis of Trypanosoma cruzi lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase.,10.1016/j.molbiopara.2003.07.004,2003-11-06,[],"Trypanosoma cruzi infection, transmitted by insect vectors or blood transfusions, is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in many Latin American countries. Treatments are toxic and frequently ineffective in curing patients with chronic manifestations of the infection (Chagas disease). Potentially exploitable chemotherapeutic targets of T. cruzi are enzymes of the sterol biosynthesis pathway. In particular, the P450 enzyme, lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase, has been implicated as the target of azole antifungal drugs that have potent anti-T. cruzi activity. In the work reported here, the T. cruzi lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase (Tc14DM) gene was cloned by degenerate PCR. The gene was found to be expressed in both insect and mammalian life-cycle stages of the parasite. Tc14DM was able to complement the function of the homologous gene in yeast (erg11) as demonstrated by restored ergosterol production in an erg11-deficient yeast strain. When the yeast strain was co-transfected with the P450 reductase gene from Trypanosoma brucei, the amount of ergosterol production was increased, indicating that the endogenous yeast P450 reductase was an inefficient partner with Tc14DM. Heterologous expression of Tc14DM in the baculovirus/Sf9 system resulted in a 52kDa product. The protein was observed to have the characteristic absorbance spectra of a P450 enzyme. A typical Type II binding spectrum was produced when the imidazole compound, ketoconazole, was mixed with the Tc14DM, demonstrating that ketoconazole binds the enzyme."
1487,Overproduction of highly active trypanosome alternative oxidase in Escherichia coli heme-deficient mutant.,10.1016/s1383-5769(03)00007-2,2003-10-11,[],"Cyanide-insensitive trypanosome alternative oxidase (TAO) is the terminal oxidase of the respiratory chain of long slender bloodstream forms of the African trypanosome, which causes sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. TAO has been targeted for the development of anti-trypanosomal drugs, because it does not exist in the host. In this study, we established a system for overproduction of highly active TAO in Eschericia coli heme-deficient mutant. Kinetic analysis of recombinant enzyme and TAO in Trypanosoma brucei brucei mitochondria revealed that recombinant TAO retains the properties of native enzyme, indicating that recombinant TAO is quite valuable for further biochemical study of TAO."
1488,Structure-function analysis of Trypanosoma brucei RNA triphosphatase and evidence for a two-metal mechanism.,10.1074/jbc.M309188200,2003-10-04,[],"Trypanosoma brucei RNA triphosphatase TbCet1 is a 252-amino acid polypeptide that catalyzes the first step in mRNA cap formation. By performing an alanine scan of TbCet1, we identified six amino acids that are essential for triphosphatase activity (Glu-52, Arg-127, Glu-168, Arg-186, Glu-216, and Glu-218). These results consolidate the proposal that protozoan, fungal, and Chlorella virus RNA triphosphatases belong to a single family of metal-dependent NTP phosphohydrolases with a unique tunnel active site composed of eight beta strands. Limited proteolysis of TbCet1 suggests that the hydrophilic N terminus is surface-exposed, whereas the catalytic core domain is tightly folded with the exception of a protease-sensitive loop (76WKGRRARKT84) between two of the putative tunnel strands. The catalytic domain of TbCet1 is extraordinarily thermostable. It remains active after heating for 2 h at 75 degrees C. Analysis by zonal velocity sedimentation indicates that TbCet1 is a monomeric enzyme, unlike fungal RNA triphosphatases, which are homodimers. We show that tripolyphosphate is a potent competitive inhibitor of TbCet1 (Ki 1.4 microm) that binds more avidly to the active site than the ATP substrate (Km 25 microm). We present evidence of synergistic activation of the TbCet1 triphosphatase by manganese and magnesium, consistent with a two-metal mechanism of catalysis. Our findings provide new insight to the similarities (in active site tertiary structure and catalytic mechanism) and differences (in quaternary structure and thermal stability) among the different branches of the tunnel enzyme family."
1489,Verification of the interaction of a tryparedoxin peroxidase with tryparedoxin by ESI-MS/MS.,10.1515/BC.2003.146,2003-10-01,[],"Tryparedoxin peroxidases (TXNPx) catalyze hydroperoxide reduction by tryparedoxin (TXN) by an enzyme substitution mechanism presumed to involve three catalytic intermediates: (i) a transient oxidation state having C52 oxidized to a sulfenic acid, (ii) the stable oxidized form with C52 disulfide-bound to C173', and (iii) a semi-reduced intermediate with C40 of TXN disulfide-linked to C173' from which the ground state enzyme is regenerated by thiol/disulfide reshuffling. This kinetically unstable form was mimmicked by a dead-end intermediate generated by cooxidation of TXNPx of Trypanosoma brucei brucei with an inhibitory mutein of TXN in which C43 was replaced by serine (TbTXNC43S). Cleavage of the isolated dead-end intermediate by trypsin plus chymotrypsin yielded a fragment that complied in size with the TbTXNC43S sequence 36 to 44 disulfide-linked to the TbTXNPx sequence 169 to 177. The presumed nature of the proteolytic fragment was confirmed by MS/MS sequencing. The results provide direct chemical evidence for the assumption that the reductive part of the catalysis is initiated by an attack of the substrate's solvent-exposed C40 on C173' of the oxidized peroxidase and, thus, confirm the hypothesis on the interaction of 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins with their proteinaceous substrates."
1490,Properties of trypanothione synthetase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/s0166-6851(03)00176-2,2003-09-12,[],"Trypanothione [N(1),N(8)-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine] plays a central role in defence against oxidant damage, ribonucleotide metabolism and in resistance to certain drugs in trypanosomatids. In Crithidia fasciculata, synthesis of trypanothione involves sequential conjugation of two molecules of glutathione (GSH) to spermidine by two enzymes: glutathionylspermidine synthetase (GspS; EC 6.3.1.8) and trypanothione synthetase (TryS; EC 6.3.1.9), whereas in Trypanosoma cruzi both steps are catalysed by an unusual TryS with broad substrate specificity. To determine which route operates in T. brucei, we have cloned and expressed a single copy gene with similarity to C. fasciculata and T. cruzi TRYS. The purified recombinant protein catalyses formation of trypanothione from either spermidine and GSH, or glutathionylspermidine and GSH. The enzyme displays high substrate inhibition with GSH as variable substrate (apparent K(m)=56 microM, K(i)(s)=37 microM, k(cat)=2.9s(-1)). At a fixed subsaturating GSH concentration (100 microM), the enzyme obeys simple hyperbolic kinetics yielding apparent K(m) values for spermidine, glutathionylspermidine and MgATP of 38, 2.4, and 7.1 microM, respectively. Recombinant TryS can also catalyse conversion of spermine to glutathionylspermine and bis(glutathionyl)spermine, as recently reported for T. cruzi. The enzyme has amidase activity that can be inhibited by iodoacetamide. Studies using GSH and polyamine analogues identified GSH as the critical determinant for recognition by the amidase domain. Thus, the biosynthesis and degradation of trypanothione are similar in African and American trypanosomes, and different from the insect trypanosomatid, C. fasciculata."
1491,Molecular and functional characterization of the first nucleobase transporter gene from African trypanosomes.,10.1016/s0166-6851(03)00167-1,2003-08-30,[],"African trypanosomes are unable to synthesize purines and depend upon purine nucleoside and nucleobase transporters to salvage these compounds from their hosts. To understand the crucial role of purine salvage in the survival of these parasites, a central objective is to identify and characterize all of the purine permeases that mediate uptake of these essential nutrients. We have cloned and functionally expressed in a purine nucleobase transport deficient strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae a novel nucleobase transporter gene, TbNT8.1, from Trypanosoma brucei. The permease encoded by this gene mediates the uptake of hypoxanthine, adenine, guanine, and xanthine with Kms in the low micromolar range. The TbNT8.1 protein is a member of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) family of permeases that occur in organisms as diverse as protozoa and mammals. TbNT8.1 is distinct from other ENT permeases that have been identified in trypanosomes in utilizing multiple purine nucleobases, rather than purine nucleosides, as substrates and is hence the first bona fide nucleobase permease identified in these parasites. Furthermore, unlike the mRNAs for other purine transporters, TbNT8.1 mRNA is significantly more abundant in insect stage procyclic forms than in mammalian stage bloodstream forms, and the TbNT8.1 permease thus may represent a major route for purine nucleobase uptake in procyclic trypanosomes."
1492,Improved trypanocidal activities of cathepsin L inhibitors.,10.1016/s0924-8579(03)00096-7,2003-08-21,[],"The major lysosomal cysteine proteinase of African trypanosomes is a candidate target for novel chemotherapy of sleeping sickness. This cathepsin L-like enzyme is termed rhodesain and brucipain in Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei brucei, respectively. Three potent and selective dipeptidyl cathepsin L inhibitors have been investigated for their trypanocidal activities in vitro using culture-adapted bloodstream forms of T. b. brucei. Compared with general cysteine proteinase inhibitors used previously by ourselves and others, the present inhibitors had improved selectivity indices and, importantly, anti-trypanosomal activities comparable with those of commercial anti-sleeping sickness drugs. Using purified recombinant rhodesain, potent k(inact)/Ki values of up to 2.3x10(6) M(-1) s(-1) were recorded with the inhibitors. Also, all inhibitors blocked proteinolysis in the lysosome consistent with the inhibition of rhodesain/brucipain. In conclusion, the data support the potential of cathepsin L inhibitors for rational anti-trypanosomal drug development."
1496,Kinetics and redox-sensitive oligomerisation reveal negative subunit cooperativity in tryparedoxin peroxidase of Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1515/BC.2003.069,2003-05-20,[],"Tryparedoxin peroxidases (TXNPx) are peroxiredoxin-type enzymes that detoxify hydroperoxides in trypanosomatids. Reduction equivalents are provided by trypanothione [T(SH)2] via tryparedoxin (TXN). The T(SH)2-dependent peroxidase system was reconstituted from TXNPx and TXN of T. brucei brucei (TbTXN-Px and TbTXN). TbTXNPx efficiently reduces organic hydroperoxides and is specifically reduced by TbTXN, less efficiently by thioredoxin, but not by glutathione (GSH) or T(SH)2. The kinetic pattern does not comply with a simple rate equation but suggests negative co-operativity of reaction centers. Gel permeation of oxidized TbTXNPx yields peaks corresponding to a decamer and higher aggregates. Electron microscopy shows regular ring structures in the decamer peak. Upon reduction, the rings tend to depolymerise forming open-chain oligomers. Co-oxidation of TbTXNPx with TbTXNC43S yields a dead-end intermediate mimicking the catalytic intermediate. Its size complies with a stoichiometry of one TXN per subunit of TXNPx. Electron microscopy of the intermediate displays pentangular structures that are compatible with a model of a decameric TbTXNPx ring with ten bound TbTXN molecules. The redox-dependent changes in shape and aggregation state, the kinetic pattern and molecular models support the view that, upon oxidation of a reaction center, other subunits adopt a conformation that has lower reactivity with the hydroperoxide."
1497,Rab5 and Rab11 mediate transferrin and anti-variant surface glycoprotein antibody recycling in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1042/BJ20030469,2003-05-15,[],"The mammalian-infective bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei possesses a highly active endocytotic system. Evasion of the host immune response by T. brucei is dependent on antigenic variation of VSG (variant surface glycoprotein), but additional mechanisms for removal of surface-bound antibody also operate. Four Rab proteins, Tb (trypanosomal) RAB4, 5A, 5B and 11 are located to the endosomal system; TbRAB5A and TbRAB11 co-localize with internalized anti-VSG antibody and transferrin. A live cell assay was used to record a single cycle of endocytosis of anti-VSG IgG and transferrin, their subsequent degradation within the endosomal system and exocytosis of the products. TbRAB5A and TbRAB11 were involved in the overall process of endocytosis, degradation and exocytosis, whereas TbRAB5B and TbRAB4 were not implicated. The kinetics of anti-VSG IgG and transferrin recycling depend on the nucleotide state of TbRAB5A and TbRAB11. These data, together with previous work, suggest that IgG and transferrin initially enter a TbRAB5A sorting endosome and are most probably recycled subsequently via a TbRAB11-dependent step. Analysis of the recycled IgG and transferrin demonstrated extensive degradation of these recycled proteins. Degradation of transferrin was enhanced in cells expressing increased amounts of TbRAB5A or TbRAB11 with a Ser-->Asn mutation, but was decreased when active TbRAB11 was overexpressed. The extent of degradation of anti-VSG IgG was found to be unaffected by mutant Rab protein expression. The presence of an efficient mechanism for the removal of IgG bound to the external surface of T. brucei and its subsequent proteolysis within the recycling system suggests a role for this pathway in immune evasion."
1498,"Subsite specificity (S3, S2, S1', S2' and S3') of oligopeptidase B from Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei using fluorescent quenched peptides: comparative study and identification of specific carboxypeptidase activity.",10.1042/BJ20030342,2003-05-10,[],"We characterized the extended substrate binding site of recombinant oligopeptidase B enzymes from Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc-OP) and Trypanosoma brucei (Tb-OP), evaluating the specificity of their S3, S2, S1', S2' and S3' subsites. Five series of internally quenched fluorescent peptides based on the substrate Abz-AGGRGAQ-EDDnp [where Abz is o -aminobenzoic acid and EDDnp is N -(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine] were designed to contain amino acid residues with side chains of a minimum size, and each residue position of this substrate was modified. Synthetic peptides of different lengths derived from the human kininogen sequence were also examined, and peptides of up to 17 amino acids were found to be hydrolysed by Tc-OP and Tb-OP. These two oligopeptidases were essentially arginyl hydrolases, since for all peptides examined the only cleavage site was the Arg-Xaa bond. We also demonstrated that Tc-OP and Tb-OP have a very specific carboxypeptidase activity for basic amino acids, which depends on the presence of at least of a pair of basic amino acids at the C-terminal end of the substrate. The peptide with triple Arg residues (Abz-AGRRRAQ-EDDnp) was an efficient substrate for Tc-OP and Tb-OP: the Arg-Ala peptide bond was cleaved first and then two C-terminal Arg residues were successively removed. The S1' subsite seems to be an important determinant of the specificity of both enzymes, showing a preference for Tyr, Ser, Thr and Gln as hydrogen donors. The presence of these amino acids at P1' resulted in substrates that were hydrolysed with K (m) values in the sub-micromolar range. Taken together, this work supports the view that oligopeptidase B is a specialized protein-processing enzyme with a specific carboxypeptidase activity. Excellent substrates were obtained for Tb-OP and Tc-OP (Abz-AMRRTISQ-EDDnp and Abz-AHKRYSHQ-EDDnp respectively), which were hydrolysed with remarkably high k (cat) and low K (m) values."
1499,Expression and function of the Trypanosoma brucei major surface protease (GP63) genes.,10.1074/jbc.M301451200,2003-04-23,[],"The genome of the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei (Tb) contains at least three gene families (TbMSP-A, -B, and -C) encoding homologues of the abundant major surface protease (MSP, previously called GP63), which is found in all Leishmania species. TbMSP-B mRNA occurs in both procyclic and bloodstream trypanosomes, whereas TbMSP-A and -C mRNAs are detected only in bloodstream organisms. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing was used to investigate the function of TbMSP-B protein. RNAi directed against TbMSP-B but not TbMSP-A ablated the steady state TbMSP-B mRNA levels in both procyclic and bloodstream cells but had no effect on the kinetics of cultured trypanosome growth in either stage. Procyclic trypanosomes have been shown previously to have an uncharacterized cell surface metalloprotease activity that can release ectopically expressed surface proteins. To determine whether TbMSP-B is responsible for this release, transgenic variant surface glycoprotein 117 (VSG117) was expressed constitutively in T. brucei procyclic TbMSP-RNAi cell lines, and the amount of surface VSG117 was determined using a surface biotinylation assay. Ablation of TbMSP-B but not TbMSP-A mRNA resulted in a marked decrease in VSG release with a concomitant increase in steady state cell-associated VSG117, indicating that TbMSP-B mediates the surface protease activity of procyclic trypanosomes. This finding is consistent with previous pharmacological studies showing that peptidomimetic collagenase inhibitors block release of transgenic VSG from procyclic trypanosomes and are toxic for bloodstream but not procyclic organisms."
1500,"Cloning, heterologous expression, and in situ characterization of the first high affinity nucleobase transporter from a protozoan.",10.1074/jbc.M301252200,2003-04-23,[],"While multiple nucleoside transporters, some of which can also transport nucleobases, have been cloned in recent years from many different organisms, no sequence information is available for the high affinity, nucleobase-selective transporters of metazoa, parazoa, or protozoa. We have identified a gene, TbNBT1, from Trypanosoma brucei brucei that encodes a 435-residue protein of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter superfamily. The gene was expressed in both the procyclic and bloodstream forms of the organism. Expression of TbNBT1 in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking an endogenous purine transporter allowed growth on adenine as sole purine source and introduced a high affinity transport activity for adenine and hypoxanthine, with Km values of 2.1 +/- 0.6 and 0.66 +/- 0.22 microm, respectively, as well as high affinity for xanthine, guanine, guanosine, and allopurinol and moderate affinity for inosine. A transporter with an indistinguishable kinetic profile was identified in T. b. brucei procyclics and designated H4. RNA interference of TbNBT1 in procyclics reduced cognate mRNA levels by approximately 80% and H4 transport activity by approximately 90%. Expression of TbNBT1 in Xenopus oocytes further confirmed that this gene encodes the first high affinity nucleobase transporter from protozoa or animals to be identified at the molecular level."
1501,Stage-specific differences in cell cycle control in Trypanosoma brucei revealed by RNA interference of a mitotic cyclin.,10.1074/jbc.M300813200,2003-04-19,[],"African trypanosomes have a tightly coordinated cell cycle to effect efficient segregation of their single organelles, the nucleus, flagellum, and kinetoplast. To investigate cell cycle control in trypanosomes, a mitotic cyclin gene (CYC6) has been identified in Trypanosoma brucei. We show that CYC6 forms an active kinase complex with CRK3, the trypanosome CDK1 homologue, in vivo. Using RNA interference, we demonstrate that absence of CYC6 mRNA results in a mitotic block and growth arrest in both the insect procyclic and mammalian bloodstream forms. In the procyclic form, CYC6 RNA interference generates anucleate cells with a single kinetoplast, whereas in bloodstream form trypanosomes, cells with one nucleus and multiple kinetoplasts are observed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis shows that bloodstream but not procyclic trypanosomes are able to reinitiate nuclear S phase in the absence of mitosis. Taken together, these data show that procyclic trypanosomes can undergo cytokinesis without completion of mitosis, whereas a mitotic block in bloodstream form trypanosomes inhibits cytokinesis but not kinetoplast replication and segregation nor an additional round of nuclear DNA synthesis. This indicates that there are fundamental differences in cell cycle controls between life cycle forms of T. brucei and that key cell cycle checkpoints present in higher eukaryotes are absent from trypanosomes."
1502,"Properties of phosphoenolpyruvate mutase, the first enzyme in the aminoethylphosphonate biosynthetic pathway in Trypanosoma cruzi.",10.1074/jbc.M302419200,2003-04-04,[],"Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) mutase catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate, the initial step in the formation of many naturally occurring phosphonate compounds. The phosphonate compound 2-aminoethylphosphonate is present as a component of complex carbohydrates on the surface membrane of many trypanosomatids including glycosylinositolphospholipids of Trypanosoma cruzi. Using partial sequence information from the T. cruzi genome project we have isolated a full-length gene with significant homology to PEP mutase from the free-living protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis and the edible mussel Mytilus edulis. Recombinant expression in Escherichia coli confirms that it encodes a functional PEP mutase with a Km apparent of 8 microM for phosphonopyruvate and a kcat of 12 s-1. The native enzyme is a homotetramer with an absolute requirement for divalent metal ions and displays negative cooperativity for Mg2+ (S0.5 0.4 microM; n = 0.46). Immunofluorescence and sub-cellular fractionation indicates that PEP mutase has a dual localization in the cell. Further evidence to support this was obtained by Western analysis of a partial sub-cellular fractionation of T. cruzi cells. Southern and Western analysis suggests that PEP mutase is unique to T. cruzi and is not present in the other medically important parasites, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania spp."
1503,X-ray structure determination of Trypanosoma brucei ornithine decarboxylase bound to D-ornithine and to G418: insights into substrate binding and ODC conformational flexibility.,10.1074/jbc.M300188200,2003-04-04,[],"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the rate-determining step in the biosynthesis of polyamines. ODC is a proven drug target to treat African sleeping sickness. The x-ray crystal structure of Trypanosoma brucei ODC in complex with d-ornithine (d-Orn), a substrate analog, and G418 (Geneticin), a weak non-competitive inhibitor, was determined to 2.5-A resolution. d-Orn forms a Schiff base with PLP, and the side chain is in a similar position to that observed for putrescine and alpha-difluoromethylornithine in previous T. brucei ODC structures. The d-Orn carboxylate is positioned on the solvent-exposed side of the active site (si face of PLP), and Gly-199, Gly-362, and His-197 are the only residues within 4.2 A of this moiety. This structure confirms predictions that the carboxylate of d-Orn binds on the si face of PLP, and it supports a model in which the carboxyl group of the substrate l-Orn would be buried on the re face of the cofactor in a pocket that includes Phe-397, Tyr-389, Lys-69 (methylene carbons), and Asp-361. Electron density for G418 was observed at the boundary between the two domains within each ODC monomer. A ten-amino acid loop region (392-401) near the 2-fold axis of the dimer interface, which contributes several residues that form the active site, is disordered in this structure. The disordering of residues in the active site provides a potential mechanism for inhibition by G418 and suggests that allosteric inhibition from this site is feasible."
1505,Sugar derivatives as new 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase inhibitors selective for the parasite Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/s0968-0896(02)00650-8,2003-03-12,[],Sugar derivatives mimicking compounds which take part in the catalysed reaction have been assayed as alternative substrates and/or competitive inhibitors of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma brucei and sheep liver. Phosphonate analogues have been synthesised and the new compound 5-deoxy-5-phosphono-D-arabinonate shows good selectivity towards the parasite enzyme. A number of 4-carbon and 5-carbon aldonates are strong inhibitors of the parasite enzyme with K(i) values below the substrate K(m) and some acyl derivatives are also potent inhibitors. At least five of the compounds showing a significant selectivity for the parasite enzyme represent leads for trypanocidal drugs against this recently validated target.
1506,Ornithine decarboxylase promotes catalysis by binding the carboxylate in a buried pocket containing phenylalanine 397.,10.1021/bi026795z,2003-03-12,[],"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation of l-Orn to putrescine, a rate-limiting step in the formation of polyamines. The X-ray crystal structures of ODC, complexed to several ligands, support a model where the substrate is oriented with the carboxyl-leaving group buried on the re face of the PLP cofactor. This binding site is composed of hydrophobic and electron-rich residues, in which Phe-397 is predicted to form a close contact. Mutation of Phe-397 to Ala reduces the steady-state rate of product formation by 150-fold. Moreover, single turnover analysis demonstrates that the rate of the decarboxylation step is decreased by 2100-fold, causing this step to replace product release as the rate-limiting step in the mutant enzyme. These data support the structural prediction that the carboxyl-leaving group is positioned to interact with Phe-397. Multiwavelength stopped-flow analysis of reaction intermediates suggests that a major product of the reaction with the mutant enzyme is pyridoximine 5'-phosphate (PMP), resulting from incorrect protonation of the decarboxylated intermediate at the C4' position. This finding was confirmed by HPLC analysis of the reaction products, demonstrating that Phe-397 also plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the reaction chemistry. The finding that the carboxylate-leaving group is oriented on the buried side of the PLP cofactor suggests that ODC facilitates decarboxylation by destabilizing the charged substrate carboxyl group in favor of an electrostatically more neutral transition state."
1510,Trypanosome-induced modulation of responses to concurrent helminth infection.,10.1016/s0034-5288(02)00152-2,2003-01-01,[],Infections with African trypanosomes are known to suppress immune responses to vaccines and to gastrointestinal nematode infections in livestock. Experimental infections with Trypanosoma brucei (Tb) and the gastrointestinal nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb) in mice were used to identify possible mechanisms involved in interference with anti-worm responses and to examine the effects of host genotype on the extent of suppression seen. Concurrent infections with T. brucei resulted in a prolongation of worm survival and a dramatic increase in faecal egg output. Infection also resulted in a marked suppression of the proliferative response of mesenteric lymphocytes (MLNC) to in vitro mitogenic stimulation. When MLNC from concurrently infected mice were stimulated in vitro with the mitogen ConA they released more IFN-gamma and less IL-5 than cells from mice infected only with N. brasiliensis. These data are interpreted in terms of a trypanosome-mediated influence on the development of host-protective type-2 T helper cell responses against N. brasiliensis. The degree to which T. brucei altered the kinetics of the nematode infection was influenced by the particular mouse strain concerned.
1511,"Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase, an essential enzyme and potential drug target in kinetoplastid parasites.",10.1074/jbc.M211391200,2002-12-19,[],"Co-translational modification of eukaryotic proteins by N-myristoylation aids subcellular targeting and protein-protein interactions. The enzyme that catalyzes this process, N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), has been characterized in the kinetoplastid protozoan parasites, Leishmania and Trypanosoma brucei. In Leishmania major, the single copy NMT gene is constitutively expressed in all parasite stages as a 48.5-kDa protein that localizes to both membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. Leishmania NMT myristoylates the target acylated Leishmania protein, HASPA, when both are co-expressed in Escherichia coli. Gene targeting experiments have shown that NMT activity is essential for viability in Leishmania. In addition, overexpression of NMT causes gross changes in parasite morphology, including the subcellular accumulation of lipids, leading to cell death. This phenotype is more extreme than that observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which overexpression of NMT activity has no obvious effects on growth kinetics or cell morphology. RNA interference assays in T. brucei have confirmed that NMT is also an essential protein in both life cycle stages of this second kinetoplastid species, suggesting that this enzyme may be an appropriate target for the development of anti-parasitic agents."
1512,A second class of peroxidases linked to the trypanothione metabolism.,10.1074/jbc.M210392200,2002-12-06,[],"Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, has three nearly identical genes encoding cysteine homologues of classical selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidases. The proteins are expressed in the mammalian and insect stages of the parasite. One of the genes, which contains a mitochondrial as well as a glycosomal targeting signal has been overexpressed. The recombinant T. brucei peroxidase has a high preference for the trypanothione/tryparedoxin couple as electron donor for the reduction of different hydroperoxides but accepts also T. brucei thioredoxin. The apparent rate constants k(2)' for the regeneration of the reduced enzyme are 2 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1) with tryparedoxin and 5 x 10(3) m(-1) s(-1) with thioredoxin. No saturation kinetics was observed and the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction is reduction of the hydroperoxide. With glutathione, the peroxidase has marginal activity and reduction of the enzymes becomes limiting with a k(2)' value of 3 m (-1) s(-1). The T. brucei peroxidase, in contrast to the related Trypanosoma cruzi enzyme, also accepts hydrogen peroxide as substrate. The catalytic efficiency of the peroxidase studied here is comparable with that of the peroxiredoxin-like tryparedoxin peroxidases, which shows that trypanosomes possess two distinct peroxidase systems both dependent on the unique dithiol trypanothione."
1513,Induced neuronal expression of class I major histocompatibility complex mRNA in acute and chronic inflammation models.,10.1016/s0165-5728(02)00258-8,2002-11-30,[],Studies have demonstrated neuronal expression of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mRNA and protein in normal and developing brain and in response to injury or viral infection. We report neuronal expression of class I MHC mRNA in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons in rats following systemic infection with Trypanosoma brucei brucei parasites (chronic) and in response to intravenous 1 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide administration (acute peripheral) and in striatal neurons following intrastriatal 5 microg lipopolysaccharide injection (acute central). These results demonstrate that neurons can be a source of immune signaling molecules and establish class I MHC as part of the neuronal component of immune responses.
1514,Role of uridylate-specific exoribonuclease activity in Trypanosoma brucei RNA editing.,10.1128/EC.1.1.112-118.2002,2002-11-29,[],"Editing of mitochondrial mRNAs in kinetoplastid protozoa occurs by a series of enzymatic steps that insert and delete uridylates (U's) as specified by guide RNAs (gRNAs). The characteristics of the 3' exonuclease activity that removes the U's following cleavage during deletion editing were determined by using an in vitro precleaved deletion assay that is based on ATPase subunit 6 pre-mRNA and gA6[14] gRNA. The exonuclease in partially purified editing complexes is specific for U's. The specificity occurs in the absence of gRNA, but its activity is enhanced by the presence of gRNA. The 3' pre-mRNA fragment enhances the specificity, but not the efficiency, of U removal. The activity is sensitive to the 5' phosphate of the 3' fragment, which is not required for U removal. The ability of the 3' U's to base pair with purines in the gRNA protects them from removal, suggesting that the U-specific 3' exonuclease (exoUase) is specific for U's which are not base paired. ExoUase is stereospecific and cannot remove (Rp)alpha-thio-U. The specificity of the exoUase activity thus contributes to the precision of RNA editing."
1515,Specificity and kinetics of a mitochondrial peroxiredoxin of Leishmania infantum.,10.1016/s0891-5849(02)01088-2,2002-11-26,[],"In Kinetoplastida, comprising the medically important parasites Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, and Leishmania species, 2-Cys peroxiredoxins described to date have been shown to catalyze reduction of peroxides by the specific thiol trypanothione using tryparedoxin, a thioredoxin-related protein, as an immediate electron donor. Here we show that a mitochondrial peroxiredoxin from L. infantum (LimTXNPx) is also a tryparedoxin peroxidase. In an heterologous system constituted by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), T. cruzi trypanothione reductase, trypanothione and Crithidia fasciculata tryparedoxin (CfTXN1 and CfTXN2), the recombinant enzyme purified from Escherichia coli as an N-terminally His-tagged protein preferentially reduces H(2)O(2) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide and less actively cumene hydroperoxide. Linoleic acid hydroperoxide and phosphatidyl choline hydroperoxide are poor substrates in the sense that they are reduced weakly and inhibit the enzyme in a concentration- and time-dependent way. Kinetic parameters deduced for LimTXNPx are a k(cat) of 37.0 s(-1) and K(m) values of 31.9 and 9.1 microM for CfTXN2 and tert-butyl hydroperoxide, respectively. Kinetic analysis indicates that LimTXNPx does not follow the classic ping-pong mechanism described for other TXNPx (Phi(1,2) = 0.8 s x microM(2)). Although the molecular mechanism underlying this finding is unknown, we propose that cooperativity between the redox centers of subunits may explain the unusual kinetic behavior observed. This hypothesis is corroborated by high-resolution electron microscopy and gel chromatography that reveal the native enzyme to preferentially exist as a homodecameric ring structure composed of five dimers."
1516,Stage-specific requirement of a mitogen-activated protein kinase by Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1091/mbc.e02-02-0093,2002-11-14,[],"In cycling between the mammalian host and the tsetse fly vector, African trypanosomes undergo adaptive differentiation steps that are coupled to growth control. The signaling pathways underlying these cellular processes are largely unknown. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are known mediators of growth and differentiation in other eukaryotic organisms. To establish the function of a MAPK homologue, TbMAPK2, in T. brucei, a null mutant was constructed. Bloodstream forms of a deltamapk2/deltamapk2 clone were able to grow normally and exhibited no detectable phenotype. When these cells were triggered to differentiate in vitro, however, they developed to the procyclic (fly midgut) form with delayed kinetics and subsequently underwent cell cycle arrest. Introduction of an ectopic copy of the TbMAPK2 gene into the null mutant restored its ability to differentiate and to divide. In contrast, a TbMAPK2 mutant, in which the T190 and Y192 residues of the activating phosphorylation site were replaced by A and F, was unable to restore the growth and differentiation phenotypes. Analysis of the DNA content and the nucleus/kinetoplast configuration of individual cells showed that the null mutant was arrested in all phases of the cell cycle and that 25-30% of the cells had failed to segregate their nucleus and kinetoplast correctly. This implies that cell cycle progression by the procyclic form depends on a constitutive stimulus exerted by the signaling cascade operating through TbMAPK2."
1517,Epithelial innate immunity. A novel antimicrobial peptide with antiparasitic activity in the blood-sucking insect Stomoxys calcitrans.,10.1074/jbc.M206296200,2002-10-10,[],"The gut epithelium is an essential interface in insects that transmit parasites. We investigated the role that local innate immunity might have on vector competence, taking Stomoxys calcitrans as a model. S. calcitrans is sympatric with tsetse flies, feeds on many of the same vertebrate hosts, and is thus regularly exposed to the trypanosomes that cause African sleeping sickness and nagana. Despite this, S. calcitrans is not a cyclical vector of these trypanosomes. Trypanosomes develop exclusively in the lumen of digestive organs, and so epithelial immune mechanisms, and in particular antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), may be the prime determinants of the fate of an infection. To investigate why S. calcitrans is not a cyclical vector of trypanosomes, we have looked in its midgut for AMPs with trypanolytic activity. We have identified a new AMP of 42 amino acids, which we named stomoxyn, constitutively expressed and secreted exclusively in the anterior midgut of S. calcitrans. It displays an amphipathic helical structure and exhibits a broad activity spectrum affecting the growth of microorganisms. Interestingly, this AMP exhibits trypanolytic activity to Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. We argue that stomoxyn may help to explain why S. calcitrans is not a vector of trypanosomes causing African sleeping sickness and nagana."
1520,Characterization of quinonoid-dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR) from the lower eukaryote Leishmania major.,10.1074/jbc.M206543200,2002-08-02,[],"Biopterin is required for growth of the protozoan parasite Leishmania and is salvaged from the host through the activities of a novel biopterin transporter (BT1) and broad-spectrum pteridine reductase (PTR1). Here we characterize Leishmania major quinonoid-dihydropteridine reductase (LmQDPR), the key enzyme required for regeneration and maintenance of H(4)biopterin pools. LmQDPR shows good homology to metazoan quinonoid-dihydropteridine reductase and conservation of domains implicated in catalysis and regulation. Unlike other organisms, LmQDPR is encoded by a tandemly repeated array of 8-9 copies containing LmQDPR plus two other genes. QDPR mRNA and enzymatic activity were expressed at similar levels throughout the infectious cycle. The pH optima, kinetic properties, and substrate specificity of purified LmQDPR were found to be similar to that of other qDPRs, although it lacked significant activity for non-quinonoid pteridines. These and other data suggest that LmQDPR is unlikely to encode the dihydrobiopterin reductase activity (PTR2) described previously. Similarly LmQDPR is not inhibited by a series of antifolates showing anti-leishmanial activity beyond that attributable to dihydrofolate reductase or PTR1 inhibition. qDPR activity was found in crude lysates of Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi, further emphasizing the importance of H(4)biopterin throughout this family of human parasites."
1522,A vacuolar-type H+-pyrophosphatase governs maintenance of functional acidocalcisomes and growth of the insect and mammalian forms of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.M204744200,2002-07-18,[],"Vacuolar proton pyrophosphatases (V-H(+)-PPases) are electrogenic proton pumps found in many organisms of considerable industrial, environmental, and clinical importance. V-H(+)-PPases of several parasites were shown to be associated with acidic vacuoles named acidocalcisomes, which contain polyphosphate and calcium. In this work we functionally characterized a Trypanosoma brucei V-H(+)-PPase gene by using double-stranded RNA interference methodology to produce inducible V-H(+)-PPase-deficient strains of procyclic and bloodstream forms (PFiVP1 and BFiVP1). Acidocalcisomes of these mutated parasites lost acidity and contained 90% less polyphosphate. PFiVP1 did not release calcium after the addition of nigericin, and its total acidity was reduced by 70%. This mutant also failed to stabilize its intracellular pH on exposure to external basic pH >7.4 and recovered from intracellular acidification at a slower rate and to a more acidic final intracellular pH. In the absence of T. brucei V-H(+)-PPase expression, PFiVP1 and BFiVP1 grew at a slower rate with doubling times of 27 h instead of 15 h, and 10 h instead of 7.5 h, respectively. Moreover, BFiVP1 could not grow over 5 x 10(5) cells/ml corresponding to a cell density reduction of five times for bloodstream form stationary phase growth."
1524,"Cloning, heterologous expression, and substrate specificities of protein farnesyltransferases from Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania major.",10.1016/s0166-6851(02)00099-3,2002-07-11,[],"Chagas disease and leishmaniasis are tropical diseases caused by the protozoan parasites, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania species, respectively. Protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) is being investigated as a target for anti-trypanosomatid agents because inhibitors of this enzyme are highly toxic to these parasites compared to mammalian cells. Here, we report the cloning of the alpha- and beta-subunit genes of PFT from T. cruzi and Leishmania major. The proteins encoded by these genes are considerably larger than those of mammalian PFTs due to the presence of a number of inserts of >25 amino acids that map to junctions between helical structural elements. These inserts are not part of the active site or the interface between the two subunits. Northern blots demonstrate expression of messenger RNA for the PFT subunits in both mammalian and insect life-cycle stages of these parasites. The T. cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, and L. major PFTs were overexpressed in the Sf9 cell/baculovirus system as active enzyme forms. Kinetic studies with a panel of CALX-containing peptides with all 20 amino acids in the X-position show that trypanosomatid PFTs have similar substrate specificities and these are different from the mammalian PFT substrate specificity patterns."

The alkaloid displays an unusual 7,3'-linkage between the naphthalene and the isoquinoline portions. Due to the resulting medium degree of steric hindrance exerted by the ortho-substituents next to the biaryl axis, the compound undergoes slow rotation about the axis at room temperature and thus is the first such alkaloid that occurs as a mixture of two configurationally semi-stable atropo-diastereomers. Dioncophylline E exhibits good antimalarial activity against both chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum while its antitrypanosomal activity against Trypanosoma cruzi is weak and that against T. brucei rhodesiense is moderate. Furthermore, four additional naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids previously known from the related plant species Triphyophyllum peltatum, have been identified in D. thollonii."
1527,Cysteine-less glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C is inhibited competitively by a thiol reagent: evidence for glyco-mimicry by p-chloromercuriphenylsulphonate.,10.1042/BJ20020367,2002-05-16,[],"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-specific phospholipases are highly valuable for studying the structure and function of GPIs. GPI-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) from Trypanosoma brucei and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from Bacillus cereus are the most widely studied of this class of phospholipases C. Inhibition of protein activity by thiol reagents is indicative of the participation of cysteine residues in biochemical events. The thiol reagent p-chloromercuriphenylsulphonate (pCMPS) inhibits T. brucei GPI-PLC, which has eight cysteine residues. Surprisingly, we found that the activity of B. cereus PI-PLC is also blocked by pCMPS, although the protein does not contain cysteine residues. Inhibition of B. cereus PI-PLC was reversed when pCMPS was size-separated from a preformed pCMPS.PI-PLC complex. In contrast, no activity was recovered when T. brucei GPI-PLC was subjected to a similar protocol. Equimolar beta-mercaptoethanol (beta-ME) reversed the inhibition of PI-PLC activity in a pCMPS.PI-PLC complex. For T. brucei GPI-PLC, however, ultrafiltration of the pCMPS.GI-PLC complex and addition of a large excess of beta-ME was necessary for partial recovery of enzyme activity. Thus T. brucei GPI-PLC is susceptible to inactivation by covalent modification with pCMPS, whereas PI-PLC is not. Kinetic analysis indicated that pCMPS was a competitive inhibitor of PI-PLC when a GPI was a substrate. Curiously, with phosphatidylinositol as substrate, inhibition was no longer competitive. These data suggest that pCMPS is a glyco-mimetic that occupies the glycan binding site of PI-PLC, from where, depending on the substrate, it inhibits catalysis allosterically or competitively."
1528,Constitutive and inflammatory induction of alpha and beta chemokines in human first trimester forebrain astrocytes and neurons.,10.1016/s0161-5890(02)00019-6,2002-05-16,[],"Chemokine effects on leukocyte infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) are key events in the inflammatory processes of neuroimmunologic and neuroinfectious diseases. Because, chemokines may play important roles in proliferation and differentiation of brain cells and in the initiation and progression of CNS inflammatory disorders, we analyzed constitutive and inflammatory-induced expression of alpha and beta chemokines in human first trimester forebrain cells. Constitutive induction of IL-8, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MCP-1 and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted (Rantes) was detected in cryostat sections of embryonic forebrains in an age-dependent manner. Dissociated cell cultures were studied for spontaneous chemokine induction and after stimulation with the trypanosome lymphocyte triggering factor (TLTF), a novel trypanokine secreted by African trypanosomes that triggers a complex of immune responses. LPS and variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) were used as controls. In cultures, unstimulated cells expressed minimal chemokine levels except for Rantes. In response to TLTF and LPS, but not VSG, all chemokines were highly induced at the mRNA and protein levels in a dose- and age-dependent manner. Combined assays (in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry) revealed that astrocytes and neurons are major sources for chemokines. These results illustrate the ability of resident brain cells to constitutively express chemokine genes, which may suggest an important role for chemokines during brain development. Furthermore, TLTF-induced chemokine expression in astrocytes and neurons indicate the capacity of TLTF to provoke neuroinflammation in the brain, which may have important therapeutic implications for the neurological manifestations of African trypanosomiasis."
1531,N-terminal N-myristoylation of proteins: refinement of the sequence motif and its taxon-specific differences.,10.1006/jmbi.2002.5425,2002-04-17,[],"N-terminal N-myristoylation is a lipid anchor modification of eukaryotic and viral proteins targeting them to membrane locations, thus changing the cellular function of modified proteins. Protein myristoylation is critical in many pathways; e.g. in signal transduction, apoptosis, or alternative extracellular protein export. The myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) recognizes the sequence motif of appropriate substrate proteins at the N terminus and attaches the lipid moiety to the absolutely required N-terminal glycine residue. Reliable recognition of capacity for N-terminal myristoylation from the substrate protein sequence alone is desirable for proteome-wide function annotation projects but the existing PROSITE motif is not practical, since it produces huge numbers of false positive and even some false negative predictions. As a first step towards a new prediction method, it is necessary to refine the sequence motif coding for N-terminal N-myristoylation. Relying on the in-depth study of the amino acid sequence variability of substrate proteins, on binding site analyses in X-ray structures or 3D homology models for NMTs from various taxa, and on consideration of biochemical data extracted from the scientific literature, we found indications that, at least within a complete substrate protein, the N-terminal 17 protein residues experience different types of variability restrictions. We identified three motif regions: region 1 (positions 1-6) fitting the binding pocket; region 2 (positions 7-10) interacting with the NMT's surface at the mouth of the catalytic cavity; and region 3 (positions 11-17) comprising a hydrophilic linker. Each region was characterized by physical requirements to single sequence positions or groups of positions regarding volume, polarity, backbone flexibility and other typical properties of amino acids (http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/myristate/). These specificity differences are confined partly to taxonomic ranges and are proposed for the design of NMT inhibitors in pathogenic fungal and protozoan systems including Aspergillus fumigatus, Leishmania major, Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, Giardia intestinalis, Entamoeba histolytica, Pneumocystis carinii, Strongyloides stercoralis and Schistosoma mansoni. An exhaustive search for NMT-homologues led to the discovery of two putative entomopoxviral NMTs."
1532,Six related nucleoside/nucleobase transporters from Trypanosoma brucei exhibit distinct biochemical functions.,10.1074/jbc.M202319200,2002-04-09,[],"Purine nucleoside and nucleobase transporters are of fundamental importance for Trypanosoma brucei and related kinetoplastid parasites because these protozoa are not able to synthesize purines de novo and must salvage the compounds from their hosts. In the studies reported here, we have identified a family of six clustered genes in T. brucei that encode nucleoside/nucleobase transporters. These genes, TbNT2/927, TbNT3, TbNT4, TbNT5, TbNT6, and TbNT7, have predicted amino acid sequences that show high identity to each other and to TbNT2, a P1 type nucleoside transporter recently identified in our laboratory. Expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that TbNT2/927, TbNT5, TbNT6, and TbNT7 are high affinity adenosine/inosine transporters with K(m) values of <5 microm. In addition, TbNT5, and to a limited degree TbNT6 and TbNT7, also mediate the uptake of the nucleobase hypoxanthine. Ribonuclease protection assays showed that mRNA from all of the six members of this gene family are expressed in the bloodstream stage of the T. brucei life cycle but that TbNT2/927 and TbNT5 mRNAs are also expressed in the insect stage of the life cycle. These results demonstrate that T. brucei expresses multiple purine transporters with distinct substrate specificities and different patterns of expression during the parasite life cycle."
1533,Phospholipase A2 from Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei brucei: inhibition by organotins.,10.1080/14756360109162392,2002-03-28,[],"Activity and kinetics of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (Wellcome strain) and Trypanosoma brucei brucei (GUTat 3.1) were examined using two different fluorescent substrates. The activity in the supernatants of sonicated parasites was Ca2+-independent, strongly stimulated by Triton X-100 with optimum activity at 37 degrees C and pH 6.5-8.5. To encourage a possible interaction between the parasite enzyme and organotin compounds, fatty acid derivatives of dibutyltin dichloride were synthesized and evaluated as potential inhibitors of PLA2. The enzyme from the two-trypanosome species differ with respect to kinetic parameters and are noncompetitively inhibited by the organotin compounds. The Michaelis constant (KM) for PLA2 from T. b. brucei is 63.87 and 30.90 microM while for T. b. gambiense it is 119.64 and 32.91 microM for the substrates 1,2-bis-(1-pyrenebutanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PBGPC) and 2-(12-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)dodecanoyl-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBDC12-HPC), respectively."
1535,"Catalytic properties, thiol pK value, and redox potential of Trypanosoma brucei tryparedoxin.",10.1074/jbc.M112115200,2002-02-28,[],"The dithiol protein tryparedoxin is a component of the unique trypanothione/trypanothione reductase metabolism of trypanosomatids and is involved in the parasite synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides and the detoxication of hydroperoxides. Tryparedoxin is a highly abundant protein in all life stages of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. As shown here, its functional properties are intermediate between those of classical thioredoxins and glutaredoxins. The redox potential of T. brucei tryparedoxin of -249 mV was determined by protein-protein redox equilibration with Escherichia coli thioredoxin. The trypanothione/tryparedoxin couple is probably the most significant factor determining the cytosolic redox potential of the parasites. The pK value of Cys(40), the first thiol in the WCPPC motif, is 7.2 as derived from the thiolate absorption at 240 nm and the rate of carboxymethylation. Alteration of the active site into that of thioredoxin (CGPC) did not affect the pK value. In contrast, in the mutant with the glutaredoxin motif (CPYC) the pK dropped to < or =4.0. The fact that the pK value of tryparedoxin coincides with the intracellular pH of the parasite may contribute to the reactivity of tryparedoxin in thiol disulfide exchange reactions."
1536,Novel FMN-containing rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma brucei mitochondria: isolation and characterization.,10.1021/bi015989w,2002-02-28,[],"A rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase has been isolated from the mitochondria of the procyclic form of African parasite, Trypanosoma brucei. The active form of the purified enzyme appears to be a dimer consisting of two 33-kDa subunits with noncovalently bound FMN as a cofactor. Hypotonic treatment of intact mitochondria revealed that the NADH dehydrogenase is located in the inner membrane/matrix fraction facing the matrix. The treatment of mitochondria with increasing concentrations of digitonin suggested that the NADH dehydrogenase is loosely bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane. The NADH:ubiquinone reductase activity is insensitive to rotenone, flavone, or dicumarol; however, it was inhibited by diphenyl iodonium in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Maximum inhibition by diphenyl iodonium required preincubation with NADH to reduce the flavin. More complete inhibition was obtained with the more hydrophobic electron acceptors, such as Q(1) or Q(2), as compared to the more hydrophilic ones, such as Q(0) or dichloroindophenol. Kinetic analysis of the enzyme indicated that the enzyme followed a ping-pong mechanism. The enzyme conducts a one-electron transfer and can reduce molecular oxygen forming superoxide radical."
1538,Mechanism of the gBP21-mediated RNA/RNA annealing reaction: matchmaking and charge reduction.,10.1093/nar/30.2.447,2002-01-15,[],"The guide RNA-binding protein gBP21 has been characterized as a mitochondrial RNA/RNA annealing factor. The protein co-immunoprecipitates with RNA editing ribonucleoprotein complexes, which suggests that gBP21 contributes its annealing activity to the RNA editing machinery. In support of this view, gBP21 was found to accelerate the hybridization of cognate guide (g)RNA/pre-edited mRNA pairs. Here we analyze the mechanism of the gBP21-mediated RNA annealing reaction. Three possible modes of action are considered: chaperone function, matchmaker function and product stabilization. We conclude that gBP21 works as a matchmaker by binding to gRNAs as one of the two RNA annealing reactants. Three lines of evidence substantiate this model. First, gBP21 and gRNAs form a thermodynamically and kinetically stable complex in a 1 + 1 stoichiometry. Secondly, gRNA-bound gBP21 stabilizes single-stranded RNA, which can be considered the transition state in the annealing reaction. Thirdly, gBP21 has a low affinity for double-stranded RNAs, suggesting the release of the annealed reaction product after the hybridization step. In the process, up to six ionic bonds are formed between gBP21 and a gRNA, which decreases the net negative charge of the RNA. As a consequence, the electrostatic repulsion between the two annealing reactants is reduced favoring the hybridization reaction."

The amino acid sequence of N. glutinosa ODC showed 90% identity with Datura stramonium ODC, and 44% identity with human ODC. N. glutinosa ODC did not possess the PEST sequence [a sequence rich in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S) and threonine (T) residues] found in mammalian ODCs, which are thought to be involved in rapid degradation of the protein. The purified ODC was a homodimeric protein, having a native M(r) of 92000. Kinetic studies of ODC showed that N. glutinosa ODC decarboxylated both l-ornithine and l-lysine with K(m) values of 562 microM and 1592 microM at different optimal pH values of 8.0 and 6.8 respectively. ODC activity was completely and irreversibly inhibited by alpha-difluoromethylornithine (K(i) 1.15 microM), showing a competitive inhibition pattern. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on ODC to introduce mutations at conserved lysine (Lys(95)) and cysteine (Cys(96), Cys(338) and Cys(377)) residues, chosen by examination of the conserved sequence, which were proven by chemical modification to be involved in enzymic activity. Except for Cys(96), each mutation caused a substantial loss in enzyme activity. Most notably, Lys(95) increased the K(m) for l-ornithine by 16-fold and for l-lysine by 3-fold, with 100-fold and 2.8-fold decreases in the k(cat) for ODC and lysine decarboxylase (LDC) activity respectively. The Cys(377)-->Ala mutant possessed a k(cat) that was lowered by 23-fold, and the K(m) value was decreased by 1.4-fold for l-ornithine. The three-dimensional model of ODC protein constructed on the basis of the crystal structure of Trypanosoma brucei, mouse and human ODCs localized the four residues in the active-site cleft. This is the first work carried out on active-site residues of plant ODC, where ODC and LDC activities occur in the same catalytic site."
1541,The regulatory subunit of a cGMP-regulated protein kinase A of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1046/j.0014-2956.2001.02564.x,2001-12-06,[],"This study reports the identification and characterization of the regulatory subunit, TbRSU, of protein kinase A of the parasitic protozoon Trypanosoma brucei. TbRSU is coded for by a single copy gene. The protein contains an unusually long N-terminal domain, the pseudosubstrate site involved in binding and inactivation of the catalytic subunit, and two C-terminally located, closely spaced cyclic nucleotide binding domains. Immunoprecipitation of TbRSU coprecipitates a protein kinase activity with the characteristics of protein kinase A: it phosphorylates a protein kinase specific substrate, and it is strongly inhibited by a synthetic protein kinase inhibitor peptide. Unexpectedly, this kinase activity could not be stimulated by cAMP, but by cGMP only. Binding studies with recombinant cyclic nucleotide binding domains of TbRSU confirmed that both domains bind cGMP with Kd values in the lower micromolar range, and that up to a 100-fold excess of cAMP does not compete with cGMP binding."
1543,Long-range interactions in the dimer interface of ornithine decarboxylase are important for enzyme function.,10.1021/bi0155908,2001-10-31,[],"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate dependent enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of polyamines. ODC is a proven drug target for the treatment of African sleeping sickness. The enzyme is an obligate homodimer, and the two identical active sites are formed at the dimer interface. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of dimer interface residues in Trypanosoma brucei ODC was undertaken to determine the energetic contribution of these residues to subunit association. Twenty-three mutant enzymes were analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation, and none of the mutations were found to cause a greater than 1 kcal/mol decrease in dimer stability. These data suggest that the energetics of the interaction may be distributed across the interface. Most significantly, many of the mutations had large effects (DeltaDeltaG kcat/Km > 2.5 kcal/mol) on the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Residues that affected activity included those in or near the substrate binding site but also a number of residues that are distant (15-20 A) from this site. These data provide evidence that long-range energetic coupling of interface residues to the active site is essential for enzyme function, even though structural changes upon ligand binding to wild-type ODC are limited to local conformational changes in the active site. The ODC dimer interface appears to be optimized for catalytic function and not for dimer stability. Thus, small molecules directed to the ODC interfaces could impact biological function without having to overcome the difficult energetic barrier of dissociating the interacting partners."
1544,A novel C-terminal kinesin is essential for maintaining functional acidocalcisomes in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.M105962200,2001-10-03,[],"Kinesins are cytoskeletal motor proteins that play roles in a variety of fundamental cellular processes including cell division and the anterograde transport of vesicles and organelles. We purified, cloned, and functionally characterized in Trypanosoma brucei a new member of the C-terminal kinesin family, TbKIFC1. Kinetic constants of the recombinant motor domain of TbKIFC1 were estimated at 0.56 microm for the microtubule dissociation constant (K(d)) with a k(cat) of 0.2 s(-1). Immunolocalization analysis showed an association of TbKIFC1 with punctate structures. Because they were rapidly transported to the negative pole of the microtubule after NH(4)Cl treatment, these structures were considered to be associated with acidic vesicles. To determine the role of the kinesin in vivo, we produced an inducible kinesin-deficient strain by double-stranded RNA interference methodology. Mutant cells were loaded with the fluorescent reagent fura2/acetoxymethylester to measure intracellular free calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)). The resting [Ca(2+)](i) was unchanged in mutant cells; however, alkalinization of acidic vesicles induced by NH(4)Cl or nigericin was not followed by release of Ca(2+). These data and the relative importance of the ionomycin-releasable and the ionomycin-plus-NH(4)Cl-releasable Ca(2+) pools suggest a lower Ca(2+) content in acidocalcisomes and dysfunctional Ca(2+) release."
1545,Four Trypanosoma brucei fatty acyl-CoA synthetases: fatty acid specificity of the recombinant proteins.,10.1042/0264-6021:3580757,2001-09-06,[],"As part of our investigation of fatty acid metabolism in Trypanosoma brucei, we have expressed four acyl-CoA synthetase (TbACS) genes in Esherichia coli. The recombinant proteins, with His-tags on their C-termini, were purified to near homogeneity using nickel-chelate affinity chromatography. Although these enzymes are highly homologous, they have distinct specificities for fatty acid chain length. TbACS1 prefers saturated fatty acids in the range C(11:0) to C(14:0) and TbACS2 prefers shorter fatty acids, mainly C(10:0). TbACS3 and 4, which have 95% sequence identity, have similar specificities, favouring fatty acids between C(14:0) and C(17:0). In addition, TbACS1, 3 and 4 function well with a variety of unsaturated fatty acids."
1546,Roles for ligases in the RNA editing complex of Trypanosoma brucei: band IV is needed for U-deletion and RNA repair.,10.1093/emboj/20.17.4694,2001-09-05,[],"Trypanosome RNA editing utilizes a seven polypeptide complex that includes two RNA ligases, band IV and band V. We now find that band IV protein contributes to the structural stability of the editing complex, so its lethal genetic knock-out could reflect structural or catalytic requirements. To assess the catalytic role in editing, we generated cell lines which inducibly replaced band IV protein with an enzymatically inactive but structurally conserved version. This induction halts cell growth, showing that catalytic activity is essential. These induced cells have impaired in vivo editing, specifically of RNAs requiring uridylate (U) deletion; unligated RNAs cleaved at U-deletion sites accumulated. Additionally, mitochondrial extracts of cells with reduced band IV activity were deficient in catalyzing U-deletion, specifically at its ligation step, but were not deficient in U-insertion. Thus band IV ligase is needed to seal RNAs in U-deletion. U-insertion does not appear to require band IV, so it might use the other ligase of the editing complex. Furthermore, band IV ligase was also found to serve an RNA repair function, both in vitro and in vivo."
1547,RNA interference of a trypanosome topoisomerase II causes progressive loss of mitochondrial DNA.,10.1093/emboj/20.17.4674,2001-09-05,[],"We studied the function of a Trypanosoma brucei topoisomerase II using RNA interference (RNAi). Expression of a topoisomerase II double-stranded RNA as a stem-loop caused specific degradation of mRNA followed by loss of protein. After 6 days of RNAi, the parasites' growth rate declined and the cells subsequently died. The most striking phenotype upon induction of RNAi was the loss of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), the cell's catenated mitochondrial DNA network. The loss of kDNA was preceded by gradual shrinkage of the network and accumulation of gapped free minicircle replication intermediates. These facts, together with the localization of the enzyme in two antipodal sites flanking the kDNA, show that a function of this topoisomerase II is to attach free minicircles to the network periphery following their replication."
1548,Structure prediction and active site analysis of the metal binding determinants in gamma -glutamylcysteine synthetase.,10.1074/jbc.M104672200,2001-08-31,[],"gamma-Glultamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) catalyzes the first step in the de novo biosynthesis of glutathione. In trypanosomes, glutathione is conjugated to spermidine to form a unique cofactor termed trypanothione, an essential cofactor for the maintenance of redox balance in the cell. Using extensive similarity searches and sequence motif analysis we detected homology between gamma-GCS and glutamine synthetase (GS), allowing these proteins to be unified into a superfamily of carboxylate-amine/ammonia ligases. The structure of gamma-GCS, which was previously poorly understood, was modeled using the known structure of GS. Two metal-binding sites, each ligated by three conserved active site residues (n1: Glu-55, Glu-93, Glu-100; and n2: Glu-53, Gln-321, and Glu-489), are predicted to form the catalytic center of the active site, where the n1 site is expected to bind free metal and the n2 site to interact with MgATP. To elucidate the roles of the metals and their ligands in catalysis, these six residues were mutated to alanine in the Trypanosoma brucei enzyme. All mutations caused a substantial loss of activity. Most notably, E93A was able to catalyze the l-Glu-dependent ATP hydrolysis but not the peptide bond ligation, suggesting that the n1 metal plays an important role in positioning l-Glu for the reaction chemistry. The apparent K(m) values for ATP were increased for both the E489A and Q321A mutant enzymes, consistent with a role for the n2 metal in ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. Furthermore, the apparent K(d) values for activation of E489A and Q321A by free Mg(2+) increased. Finally, substitution of Mn(2+) for Mg(2+) in the reaction rescued the catalytic deficits caused by both mutations, demonstrating that the nature of the metal ligands plays an important role in metal specificity."
1550,NMR spectroscopic analysis of the first two steps of the pentose-phosphate pathway elucidates the role of 6-phosphogluconolactonase.,10.1074/jbc.M105174200,2001-07-18,[],"The pentose-phosphate pathway provides reductive power and nucleotide precursors to the cell through oxidative and nonoxidative branches, respectively. 6-Phosphogluconolactonase is the second enzyme of the oxidative branch and catalyzes the hydrolysis of 6-phosphogluconolactones, the products of glucose 6-phosphate oxidation by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The role of 6-phosphogluconolactonase was still questionable, because 6-phosphogluconolactones were believed to undergo rapid spontaneous hydrolysis. In this work, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to characterize the chemical scheme and kinetic features of the oxidative branch. We show that 6-phosphogluconolactones have in fact a nonnegligible lifetime and are highly electrophilic compounds. The delta form (1-5) of the lactone is the only product of glucose 6-phosphate oxidation. Subsequently, it leads to the gamma form (1-4) by intramolecular rearrangement. However, only the delta form undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis, the gamma form being a ""dead end"" of this branch. The delta form is the only substrate for 6-phosphogluconolactonase. Therefore, 6-phosphogluconolactonase activity accelerates hydrolysis of the delta form, thus preventing its conversion into the gamma form. Furthermore, 6-phosphogluconolactonase guards against the accumulation of delta-6-phosphogluconolactone, which may be toxic through its reaction with endogenous cellular nucleophiles. Finally, the difference between activity of human, Trypanosoma brucei, and Plasmodium falciparum 6-phosphogluconolactonases is reported and discussed."
1551,Methionine regeneration and aspartate aminotransferase in parasitic protozoa.,10.1128/JB.183.15.4421-4434.2001,2001-07-10,[],"Aspartate aminotransferases have been cloned and expressed from Crithidia fasciculata, Trypanosoma brucei brucei, Giardia intestinalis, and Plasmodium falciparum and have been found to play a role in the final step of methionine regeneration from methylthioadenosine. All five enzymes contain sequence motifs consistent with membership in the Ia subfamily of aminotransferases; the crithidial and giardial enzymes and one trypanosomal enzyme were identified as cytoplasmic aspartate aminotransferases, and the second trypanosomal enzyme was identified as a mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase. The plasmodial enzyme contained unique sequence substitutions and appears to be highly divergent from the existing members of the Ia subfamily. In addition, the P. falciparum enzyme is the first aminotransferase found to lack the invariant residue G197 (P. K. Mehta, T. I. Hale, and P. Christen, Eur. J. Biochem. 214:549-561, 1993), a feature shared by sequences discovered in P. vivax and P. berghei. All five enzymes were able to catalyze aspartate-ketoglutarate, tyrosine-ketoglutarate, and amino acid-ketomethiobutyrate aminotransfer reactions. In the latter, glutamate, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and histidine were all found to be effective amino donors. The crithidial and trypanosomal cytosolic aminotransferases were also able to catalyze alanine-ketoglutarate and glutamine-ketoglutarate aminotransfer reactions and, in common with the giardial aminotransferase, were able to catalyze the leucine-ketomethiobutyrate aminotransfer reaction. In all cases, the kinetic constants were broadly similar, with the exception of that of the plasmodial enzyme, which catalyzed the transamination of ketomethiobutyrate significantly more slowly than aspartate-ketoglutarate aminotransfer. This result obtained with the recombinant P. falciparum aminotransferase parallels the results seen for total ketomethiobutyrate transamination in malarial homogenates; activity in the latter was much lower than that in homogenates from other organisms. Total ketomethiobutyrate transamination in Trichomonas vaginalis and G. intestinalis homogenates was extensive and involved lysine-ketomethiobutyrate enzyme activity in addition to the aspartate aminotransferase activity. The methionine production in these two species could be inhibited by the amino-oxy compounds canaline and carboxymethoxylamine. Canaline was also found to be an uncompetitive inhibitor of the plasmodial aspartate aminotransferase, with a K(i) of 27 microm."
1552,Specificity of GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase of GPI biosynthesis and synthesis of parasite-specific suicide substrate inhibitors.,10.1093/emboj/20.13.3322,2001-07-04,[],"The substrate specificities of Trypanosoma brucei and human (HeLa) GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylases were determined using 24 substrate analogues. The results show the following. (i) The de-N-acetylases show little specificity for the lipid moiety of GlcNAc-PI. (ii) The 3'-OH group of the GlcNAc residue is essential for substrate recognition whereas the 6'-OH group is dispensable and the 4'-OH, while not required for recognition, cannot be epimerized or substituted. (iii) The parasite enzyme can act on analogues containing betaGlcNAc or aromatic N-acyl groups, whereas the human enzyme cannot. (iv) Three GlcNR-PI analogues are de-N-acetylase inhibitors, one of which is a suicide inhibitor. (v) The suicide inhibitor most likely forms a carbamate or thiocarbamate ester to an active site hydroxy-amino acid or Cys or residue such that inhibition is reversed by certain nucleophiles. These and previous results were used to design two potent (IC50 = 8 nM) parasite-specific suicide substrate inhibitors. These are potential lead compounds for the development of anti-protozoan parasite drugs."
1554,A conserved flagellar pocket exposed high mannose moiety is used by African trypanosomes as a host cytokine binding molecule.,10.1074/jbc.M103412200,2001-06-19,[],"Trypanosomes use antigenic variation of their variant-specific surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat as defense against the host immune system. However, in order to sustain their growth, they need to expose conserved epitopes, allowing host macromolecule binding and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Here we show that Trypanosoma brucei uses the conserved chitobiose-oligomannose (GlcNAc(2)-Man(5-9)) moieties of its VSG as a binding ligand for tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a host cytokine with lectin-like properties. As endocytosis in trypanosomes is restricted to the flagellar pocket, we show that soluble flagellar pocket extracts, and in particular soluble VSG, inhibit the binding of (125)I-TNF to trypanosomes. The interaction between TNF and VSG is confirmed by affinity chromatography, biosensor, and dot-blot affinity measurements, and soluble VSG inhibition of TNF-mediated trypanolysis. In all approaches, removal of N-linked carbohydrates abrogates the TNF-VSG interaction. In addition, synthetic high mannose oligosaccharides can block TNF-VSG interactions, and a VSG glycopeptide carrying the GlcNAc(2)-Man(5-9) moiety is shown to inhibit TNF-mediated trypanosome killing in mixed parasite/macrophage cell cultures. Together, these results support the observation that TNF plays a role in growth control of trypanosomes and, moreover, suggest that, by the use of conserved VSG carbohydrates as lectin-binding epitopes, trypanosomes can limit the necessity to express large numbers of invariant surface exposed receptors."
1555,Selective inhibition of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1023/a:1011196508214,2001-06-08,[],A number of triphenylmethane derivatives have been screened against 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma brucei and sheep liver. Some of these compounds show good inhibition of the enzymes and also selectivity towards the parasite enzyme. Modelling was undertaken to dock the compounds into the active sites of both enzymes. Using a combination of DOCK 3.5 and FLEXIDOCK a correlation was obtained between docking score and both activity for the enzymes and selectivity. Visualisation of the docked structures of the inhibitors in the active sites of the enzymes yielded a possible explanation of the selectivity for the parasite enzyme.
1556,Relative contribution of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 to resistance to murine African trypanosomosis.,10.1086/320731,2001-05-24,[],"Resistance to Trypanosoma brucei brucei has been correlated with the ability of infected animals to produce interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in an early phase of infection, followed by interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 in late and chronic stages of the disease. Contributions of IFN-gamma and IL-10 in the control of parasitemia and survival of mice infected with T. brucei brucei were investigated by using IFN-gamma(-/-) and IL-10(-/-) mice. Results suggest that IFN-gamma, mainly secreted by CD8(+) T cells, is essential for parasite control via macrophage activation, which results in TNF and nitric oxide secretions. IL-10, partially secreted by CD4(+) T cells, seems to be important for the survival of infected mice. Its absence resulted in the sustained secretion of inflammatory mediators, which indicated the role of IL-10 in maintaining the balance between pathogenic and protective immune responses during African trypanosomosis."
1557,In vitro cytocidal effects on Trypanosoma brucei and inhibition of Leishmania major GP63 by peptidomimetic metalloprotease inhibitors.,10.1016/s0166-6851(01)00244-4,2001-05-18,[],"Peptidomimetic inhibitors of mammalian zinc metalloproteases have been tested as potential agents for intervention in disease caused by kinetoplastid protozoa. Certain metalloprotease inhibitors were able to inhibit the release of variant surface glycoprotein from cultured transgenic procyclic Trypanosoma brucei, confirming our previous identification of a cell surface zinc metalloprotease activity in this stage of the trypanosome lifecycle [Bangs, JD et al. Expression of bloodstream variant surface glycoproteins in procyclic stage Trypanosoma brucei: role of GPI anchors in secretion, EMBO J. 1997;16:4285]. Selected peptidomimetics were also found to be toxic for cultured bloodstream trypanosomes with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. The paradigm for zinc metalloproteases in kinetoplastids are the GP63 surface enzymes of Leishmania. Peptidomimetics at low micromolar concentrations were able to inhibit in vitro cleavage of a synthetic peptide substrate by purified GP63 from L. major. Our results suggest that zinc metalloproteases perform essential functions in different stages of the trypanosome lifecycle and we hypothesize that these activities may be affected by the recently discovered trypanosomal homologues of GP63 [El-Sayed, NMA and Donelson, JE. African trypanosomes have differentially expressed genes encoding homologues of Leishmania GP63 surface protease, J. Biol. Chem. 1997;272:26742]. Development of higher affinity metalloprotease inhibitors may provide a novel avenue for treatment of parasitic diseases."
1558,"Phospholipase from Trypanosoma brucei releases arachidonic acid by sequential sn-1, sn-2 deacylation of phospholipids.",10.1016/s0166-6851(01)00234-1,2001-05-18,[],"Previously, we showed that arachidonic acid (AA) stimulates Ca2+ currents in pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei (Eintracht J, Maathai R, Mellors A, Ruben L. Calcium entry in Trypanosoma brucei is regulated by phospholipase A2 and arachidonic acid. Biochem. J 1998;336:659-666). Here we examine the mechanism used by T. brucei to release AA from the sn-2 position of diacyl glycero-phospholipids. We report that T. brucei accomplishes this feat in the apparent absence of phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Instead, deacylation is initiated at the sn-1 position, followed by acyl migration and hydrolysis with LysoPLA. Neither whole cell homogenates nor enriched protein fractions could release AA from substrates whose sn-1 position contained a non-hydrolyzable alkyl ether linkage. These same fractions however, released AA from ester linked phospholipids, and TLC analysis of the reaction products supported the sequential deacylation process. The release of sn-2 AA from 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-PC was linear up to 90 min at an average rate of 50 nmol x min(-1) x mg(-1). sn-2 AA was processed more efficiently than sn-2 palmitate. The reaction was also greatest for: LysoPC>diacyl-PC (sn-1 labeled)>diacyl-PC (sn-2 labeled). Product formation was sensitive to polar head group, and PI was processed at less than 10% the rate of PC or PE. The enzymatic deacylation was inhibited by the serine specific reagent, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) and the cysteine reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Both NEM and MAFP inhibited LysoPLA activity under conditions where there was little effect on PLA1 activity. Overall, we conclude that T. brucei can release AA from diacyl glycero-phospholipids by a sequential deacylation process. Two independent active sites appear to be involved. Interestingly, a high percentage of inner leaflet phospholipids are protected from degradation since they occur in the non-hydrolyzable 1-alkyl ether form."
1559,Haptoglobin-related protein mediates trypanosome lytic factor binding to trypanosomes.,10.1074/jbc.M010198200,2001-05-16,[],"Trypanosome lytic factor (TLF-1) is an unusual high density lipoprotein (HDL) found in human serum that is toxic to Trypanosoma brucei brucei and may be critical in preventing human infections by this parasite. TLF-1 is composed of four major apolipoproteins: apolipoprotein AI, apolipoprotein AII, paraoxonase, and the primate-specific haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr). Hpr is greater than 90% homologous to haptoglobin (Hp), an abundant acute phase serum protein. Killing of trypanosomes by TLF-1 requires cell surface binding, endocytosis, and subsequent lysosomal targeting. Low temperature binding studies reveal two receptors for TLF-1: one that is high affinity/low capacity (K(d) approximately 12 nm, 350 receptors per cell) and another that binds with low affinity/high capacity (K(d) approximately 1 microm, 60,000 receptors per cell). The low affinity binding is competed by nonlytic human HDL and is likely to be apolipoprotein AI-mediated. Purified human Hpr and human Hp bind to trypanosomes, are internalized, and are targeted to the lysosome. Furthermore, Hpr shows competition for TLF-1 binding, and a monoclonal antibody against Hpr prevents both TLF-1 uptake and trypanosome killing. Based on these results, we propose that Hpr mediates the high affinity binding of TLF-1 to T. b. brucei through a haptoglobin-like receptor."
1562,Annealing of RNA editing substrates facilitated by guide RNA-binding protein gBP21.,10.1093/emboj/20.6.1394,2001-03-17,[],"RNA editing within the mitochondria of African trypanosomes is characterized by the insertion and deletion of uridylate residues into otherwise incomplete primary transcripts. The reaction takes place in a high molecular mass ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex of uncertain composition. Furthermore, factors that interact with the RNP complex during the reaction are by and large unknown. Here we present evidence for an editing-related biochemical activity of the gRNA-binding protein gBP21. Using recombinant gBP21 preparations, we show that the protein stimulates the annealing of gRNAs to cognate pre-mRNAs in vitro. This represents the presumed first step of the editing reaction. Kinetic data establish an enhancement of the second order rate constant for the gRNA- pre-mRNA interaction. gBP21-mediated annealing is not exclusive for RNA editing substrates since complementary RNAs, unrelated to the editing process, can also be hybridized. The gBP21-dependent RNA annealing activity was identified in mitochondrial extracts of trypanosomes and can be inhibited by immunoprecipitation of the polypeptide. The data suggest a factor-like contribution of gBP21 to the RNA editing process by accelerating the rate of gRNA-pre-mRNA anchor formation."

On the T. b.brucei mouse model, the most active compound was cis-platinum-pentamidine bromide. This compound was active when subcutaneously administered at the single dose of 1.5 micromol/kg and its chemotherapeutic index was 200 whereas pentamidine isethionate was active at 6 micromol/kg with a chemotherapeutic index of 13, when administered in the same conditions. Cis-platinum-pentamidine bromide was active at 1 mg/kg (1.44 mmoles/kg), in a single dose by subcutaneous route against the early stage of the T. b.brucei Antat 1-9 sheep model. Platinum kinetics in serum showed a Cmax of 0.2 mg/l reached 80 h after the treatment at this dose. Cis-platinum-pentamidine bromide, cis-platinum-pentamidine seleniocyanate, and cis-platinum-pentamidine thiocyanate were distributed in the deep compartment according to a monocompartmental model. In all cases, platinum was eliminated from the serum 700 hours post-treatment. All data obtained from these models show activity on the early stage of the disease and justify further investigations on the late stage of the disease."
1564,In situ kinetic characterization of methylthioadenosine transport by the adenosine transporter (P2) of the African Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.,10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00560-8,2001-02-28,[],"African trypanosomes are parasitic flagellates that live in the connective tissues of the host. Trypanosomes must obtain from their host adenine/adenosine and other nucleosides that can be salvaged through enzymatic cleavage. Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is a byproduct of polyamine metabolism, formed from the donation of an aminopropyl moiety by decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet) to form spermidine. MTA is then cleaved phosphorolytically by MTA phosphorylase to methylthioribose-1-phosphate (MTR-1-P) and adenine. The uptake of MTA was compared with that of adenosine in two strains: Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The K(m) values for MTA and adenosine (with 5 mM inosine) transport by T. b. brucei were 1.4 and 0.175 mM, and the V(max) values were 70 and 7.8 micromol/L/min, respectively. The K(m) values for T. b. rhodesiense MTA and adenosine (with 5 mM inosine) transport were 1.2 and 0.11 mM, and the V(max) values were 52.6 and 2.9 micromol/L/min, respectively. Since MTA was not competitive with either AdoMet (100 microM), inosine (100 microM), or the methionine precursor ketomethylthiobutyrate (100 microM), it appears that MTA enters through the P(2) (adenosine/adenine) transport site. From this study and our previous work, we determined that these organisms transport adenylated intermediates of methionine metabolism found in sera for purine salvage and as an ancillary source of methionine. The significant ability of African trypanosomes to transport MTA and related intermediates is an important consideration in the design and development of selective chemotherapeutic agents."

The most effective inhibitor studied was compound 12 with a Ki value of 0.151 microM. Six of the compounds described are also effective trypanocides with IC50 values < 1 microM.
1566,The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in proteolysis during Trypanosoma cruzi remodeling.,10.1021/bi001659k,2001-02-15,[],"Here, we document for the first time the presence of the 26S proteasome and the ubiquitin pathway in a protozoan parasite that is in an early branch in the eukaryotic lineage. The 26S proteasome of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes was identified as a high molecular weight complex (1400 kDa) with an ATP-dependent chymotrypsin-like activity against the substrate Suc-LLVY-Amc. This activity was inhibited by proteasome inhibitors and showed same electrophorectic migration pattern as yeast 26S proteasome in nondenaturating gels. About 30 proteins in a range of 25-110 kDa were detected in the purified T. cruzi 26S proteasome. Antibodies raised against the AAA family of ATPases from eukaryotic 26S proteasome and the T. cruzi 20S core specifically recognized components of T. cruzi 26S. To confirm the biological role of 26S in this primitive eukaryotic parasite, we analyzed the participation of the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system in protein degradation during the time of parasite remodeling. Protein turnover in trypomastigotes was proteasome and ATP-dependent and was enhanced during the transformation of the parasites into amastigotes. If 20S proteasome activity is inhibited, ubiquitinated proteins accumulate in the parasites. As expected from the profound morphological changes that occur during transformation, cytoskeletal proteins associated with the flagellum are targets of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway."
1568,Identification of a novel prostaglandin f(2alpha) synthase in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1084/jem.192.9.1327,2000-11-09,[],"Members of the genus Trypanosoma cause African trypanosomiasis in humans and animals in Africa. Infection of mammals by African trypanosomes is characterized by an upregulation of prostaglandin (PG) production in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. These metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA) may, in part, be responsible for symptoms such as fever, headache, immunosuppression, deep muscle hyperaesthesia, miscarriage, ovarian dysfunction, sleepiness, and other symptoms observed in patients with chronic African trypanosomiasis. Here, we show that the protozoan parasite T. brucei is involved in PG production and that it produces PGs enzymatically from AA and its metabolite, PGH(2). Among all PGs synthesized, PGF(2alpha) was the major prostanoid produced by trypanosome lysates. We have purified a novel T. brucei PGF(2alpha) synthase (TbPGFS) and cloned its cDNA. Phylogenetic analysis and molecular properties revealed that TbPGFS is completely distinct from mammalian PGF synthases. We also found that TbPGFS mRNA expression and TbPGFS activity were high in the early logarithmic growth phase and low during the stationary phase. The characterization of TbPGFS and its gene in T. brucei provides a basis for the molecular analysis of the role of parasite-derived PGF(2alpha) in the physiology of the parasite and the pathogenesis of African trypanosomiasis."
1571,Characterisation of the antitrypanosomal activity of peptidyl alpha-aminoalkyl phosphonate diphenyl esters.,10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00459-7,2000-10-06,[],"Two groups of irreversible serine peptidase inhibitors, peptidyl chloromethyl ketones and peptidyl phosphonate diphenyl esters, were examined for antitrypanosomal activity against the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Both peptidyl chloromethyl ketones and peptidyl phosphonate diphenyl esters inhibited trypsin-like peptidases of the parasites and exhibited antitrypanosomal activity at micromolar concentrations. In live T. b. brucei, labelled analogues of both of these groups of inhibitors primarily targeted an 80-kDa peptidase, possibly a serine oligopeptidase known as oligopeptidase B. In an in vivo mouse model of infection, one of these inhibitors, carbobenzyloxyglycyl-4-amidinophenylglycine phosphonate diphenyl ester, was curative at 5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) but appeared toxic at higher doses. There was no significant correlation between the inhibitory potency (as evaluated against purified T. b. brucei oligopeptidase B) and the in vitro antitrypanosomal efficacy of either group of inhibitors, suggesting that these inhibitors were acting on multiple targets within the parasites, or had different cell permeability properties. These findings suggest that serine peptidases may represent novel chemotherapeutic targets in African trypanosomes."
1572,Altering the reaction specificity of eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase.,10.1021/bi001209s,2000-09-14,[],"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of polyamines, and it has been identified as a drug target for the treatment of African sleeping sickness, caused by Trypanosoma brucei. ODC is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme and an obligate homodimer. X-ray structural analysis of the complex of the T. brucei wild-type enzyme with the product putrescine reveals two structural changes that occur upon ligand binding: Lys-69 is displaced by putrescine and forms new interactions with Glu-94 and Asp-88, and the side chain of Cys-360 rotates into the active site to within 3.4 A of the imine bond. Mutation of Cys-360 to Ala or Ser reduces the k(cat) of the decarboxylation reaction by 50- and 1000-fold, respectively. However, HPLC analysis of the products demonstrates that the mutant enzymes almost exclusively catalyze a decarboxylation-dependent transamination reaction to form pyridoxamine 5-phosphate (PMP) and gamma-aminobutyraldehyde, instead of PLP and putrescine. This side reaction arises when the decarboxylated substrate intermediate is protonated at C4' of PLP instead of at the C(alpha) of substrate. For the reaction catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme, this side reaction occurs infrequently (<0.01% of the turnovers). Single turnover analysis and multiwavelength stopped-flow spectroscopic studies suggest that for the mutant ODCs protonation at C4' occurs either very rapidly or in a concerted reaction with decarboxylation and that the rate-limiting step in the steady-state reaction is Schiff base hydrolysis/product release. These studies demonstrate a role for Cys-360 in the control of the C(alpha) protonation step that catalyzes the formation of the physiological product putrescine. The results further provide insight into the mechanism by which this class of PLP-dependent enzymes controls reaction specificity."
1573,Localisation of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase in the mitochondrial matrix of Trypanosoma brucei procyclics.,10.1515/znc-2000-5-626,2000-08-06,[],"Contrary to Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms do not synthesise their own sterols but take these compounds in the form of cholesterol directly from the mammalian host. However, procyclic insect stages synthesise ergosterol rather than cholesterol. Here the sub-cellular localisation of the first committed enzyme of this pathway of isoprenoid synthesis 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase in T. brucei procyclics (0.9 nmol x min(-1) x mg(-1) protein) was carried out using both cell-fractionation by isopycnic centrifugation and digitonin-titration experiments. The majority of the NADP+-linked 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase is a soluble enzyme present in the mitochondrial matrix with some additional membrane-associated activity in glycosomes and possibly in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is suggested that the active metabolism of threonine and/or leucine as preferred 2-carbon source for the incorporation of acetyl units into lipids and/or sterols in the mitochondrion of T. brucei procyclics is the explanation for a high 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity in these protozoan organelles."
1576,Molecular characterization of the first two enzymes of the pentose-phosphate pathway of Trypanosoma brucei. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconolactonase.,10.1074/jbc.M004266200,2000-06-27,[],"Trypanosomatids are parasitic protists that have part of their glycolytic pathway sequestered inside peroxisome-like organelles: the glycosomes. So far, at least one enzyme of the pentose-phosphate pathway has been found to be associated partially with glycosomes. Here, we describe how two genes from Trypanosoma brucei, coding for the first two enzymes of the pentose-phosphate pathway, i.e. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconolactonase, were identified by in silico screening of trypanosome genome project data bases. These genes were cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the lactonase sequence revealed that it contained a C-terminal peroxisome targeting signal in agreement with its subcellular localization in the bloodstream form trypanosome (15% glycosomal and 85% cytosolic). However, the dehydrogenase sequence did not reveal any targeting signal, despite its localization inside glycosomes. The corresponding enzymes have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified, and their biochemical characteristics have been determined."
1580,"Cloning, expression, and characterization of the acyl-CoA-binding protein in African trypanosomes.",10.1074/jbc.275.17.12503,2000-04-25,[],"African trypanosomes are shielded from their hosts' defenses by a coat of variant surface glycoprotein molecules, each of which is attached to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. During the later stages of glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, myristic acid is incorporated into the anchor from the donor myristoyl-CoA by a series of unique fatty acid remodeling and exchange reactions. We have cloned and expressed a recombinant trypanosome acyl-CoA-binding protein that has a preference for binding relatively short chain acyl-CoAs and that has a high affinity for binding myristoyl-CoA (K(d) = 3.5 x 10(-10) M). This protein enhances fatty acid remodeling of glycosylphosphatidylinositol precursors in the trypanosome cell-free system. We speculate that the trypanosome acyl-CoA-binding protein plays an active role in supplying myristoyl-CoA to the fatty acid remodeling machinery in the parasite."
1581,Kinetics of methionine transport and metabolism by Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.,10.1006/abbi.2000.1740,2000-04-25,[],"Methionine is an essential amino acid for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms; however, little is known concerning its utilization in African trypanosomes, protozoa of the Trypanosoma brucei group. This study explored the Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants for transport and pool formation as well as metabolic utilization of methionine by two divergent strains of African trypanosomes, Trypanosoma brucei brucei (a veterinary pathogen), highly sensitive to trypanocidal agents, and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (a human pathogenic isolate), highly refractory to trypanocidal arsenicals. The Michaelis-Menten constants derived by Hanes-Woolf analysis for transport of methionine for T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense, respectively, were as follows: K(M) values, 1. 15 and 1.75 mM; V(max) values, 3.97 x 10(-5) and 4.86 x 10(-5) mol/L/min. Very similar values were obtained by Lineweaver-Burk analysis (K(M), 0.25 and 1.0 mM; V(max), 1 x 10(-5) and 2.0 x 10(-5) mol/L/min, T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense, respectively). Cooperativity analyses by Hill (log-log) plot gave Hill coefficients (n) of 6 and 2 for T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense, respectively. Cytosolic accumulation of methionine after 10-min incubation with 25 mM exogenous methionine was 1.8-fold greater in T. b. rhodesiense than T. b. brucei (2.1 vs 1.1 mM, respectively). In African trypanosomes as in their mammalian host, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is the major product of methionine metabolism. Accumulation of AdoMet was measured by HPLC analysis of cytosolic extracts incubated in the presence of increasing cytosolic methionine. In trypanosomes incubated for 10 min with saturating methionine, both organisms accumulated similar amounts of AdoMet (approximately 23 microM), but the level of trans-sulfuration products (cystathionine and cysteine) in T. b. rhodesiense was double that of T. b. brucei. Methionine incorporation during protein synthesis in T. b. brucei was 2.5 times that of T. b. rhodesiense. These results further confirm our belief that the major pathways of methionine utilization, for polyamine synthesis, protein transmethylation and the trans-sulfuration pathway, are excellent targets for chemotherapeutic intervention against African trypanosomes."
1584,UTP-dependent and -independent pathways of mRNA turnover in Trypanosoma brucei mitochondria.,10.1128/MCB.20.7.2308-2316.2000,2000-03-14,[],"Although primary transcripts are polycistronic in the mitochondria of Trypanosoma brucei, steady-state levels of mature, monocistronic RNAs change throughout the parasitic life cycle. This indicates that steady-state RNA abundance is controlled by posttranscriptional mechanisms involving differential RNA stability. In this study, in organello pulse-chase labeling experiments were used to analyze the stability of different T. brucei mitochondrial RNA populations. In this system, total RNA and rRNA are stable for many hours. In contrast, mRNAs can be degraded by two biochemically distinct turnover pathways. The first pathway results in the rapid degradation of mRNA (half-life [t(1/2)] of 11 to 18 min) and is dependent upon the presence of an mRNA poly(A) tail. Remarkably, this pathway also requires the addition of UTP and therefore is termed UTP dependent. The second pathway results in slow turnover of mitochondrial mRNA (t(1/2) of approximately 3 h) and is not dependent upon the presence of an mRNA poly(A) tail or the addition of exogenous UTP. In summary, these results demonstrate the presence of a novel, UTP-dependent degradation pathway for T. brucei mitochondrial mRNAs and reveal an unprecedented role for both UTP and mRNA polyadenylation in T. brucei mitochondrial gene expression."
1588,A developmentally regulated aconitase related to iron-regulatory protein-1 is localized in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondrion of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.275.4.2745,2000-01-25,[],"Mitochondrial energy metabolism and Krebs cycle activities are developmentally regulated in the life cycle of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Here we report cloning of a T. brucei aconitase gene that is closely related to mammalian iron-regulatory protein 1 (IRP-1) and plant aconitases. Kinetic analysis of purified recombinant TbACO expressed in Escherichia coli resulted in a K(m) (isocitrate) of 3 +/- 0.4 mM, similar to aconitases of other organisms. This was unexpected since an arginine conserved in the aconitase protein family and crucial for substrate positioning in the catalytic center and for activity of pig mitochondrial aconitase (Zheng, L., Kennedy, M. C., Beinert, H., and Zalkin, H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 7895-7903) is substituted by leucine in the TbACO sequence. Expression of the 98-kDa TbACO was shown to be lowest in the slender bloodstream stage of the parasite, 8-fold elevated in the stumpy stage, and increased a further 4-fold in the procyclic stage. The differential expression of TbACO protein contrasted with only minor changes in TbACO mRNA, indicating translational or post-translational mechanisms of regulation. Whereas animal cells express two distinct compartmentalized aconitases, mitochondrial aconitase and cytoplasmic aconitase/IRP-1, TbACO accounts for total aconitase activity in trypanosomes. By cell fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that native as well as a transfected epitope-tagged TbACO localizes in both the mitochondrion (30%) and in the cytoplasm (70%). Together with phylogenetic reconstructions of the aconitase family, this suggests that animal IRPs have evolved from a multicompartmentalized ancestral aconitase. The possible functions of a cytoplasmic aconitase in trypanosomes are discussed."

Since immune recognition of other parasite derived factors also occurs, we examined the humoral host response against trypanosome heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), a conserved antigen with an autoimmune character. During experimental T. brucei infection in BALB/c mice, the anti-HSP60 response was induced when parasites differentiated into stumpy forms. This response was characterized by a stage-specific immunoglobulin isotype switching as well as by the induction of an autoimmune response. Specific recognition of trypanosome HSP60 was found to occur during the entire course of infection. Immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) and IgG2b antibodies, induced mainly in a T-cell-independent manner, were observed during the first peak of parasitemia, whereas IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies were found at the end of the infection, due to a specific T-cell-mediated response. Comparative analysis of the kinetics of anti-HSP60, anti-invariant surface glycoprotein 70 (ISG70), and anti-VSG antibody responses indicated that the three trypanosome antigens give rise to specific and independent patterns of immunoglobulin isotype switching."
1590,The use of transgenic Trypanosoma brucei to identify compounds inducing the differentiation of bloodstream forms to procyclic forms.,10.1016/s0166-6851(99)00157-7,1999-12-11,[],"The expression of procyclins is the earliest known marker of differentiation of bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei to procyclic forms. We have generated transgenic bloodstream and procyclic forms in which the coding region of one procyclin gene was replaced by E. coli beta-glucuronidase (GUS). GUS activity can be monitored in a simple one-step colour reaction in microtitre plates; this assay is potentially suitable for large-scale screening for compounds that influence differentiation. GUS was stage-specifically expressed in procyclic forms and its synthesis occurred in parallel with that of procyclin when bloodstream forms were triggered to differentiate by the addition of cis-aconitate. GUS could also be induced by brief treatment with the proteases trypsin, pronase or thermolysin, but not with pepsin or thrombin. Interestingly, a combination of one of the active proteases with cis-aconitate resulted in increased GUS activity relative to either trigger alone. In contrast to cis-aconitate, protease treatment resulted in considerable cell death. Experiments with the pleomorphic strain AnTat 1.1 showed that long slender bloodstream forms were rapidly killed by proteases, whereas stumpy forms were largely resistant. Stumpy forms treated with trypsin differentiated synchronously and expressed procyclin with faster kinetics than when they were triggered by cis-aconitate. As predicted by the GUS assay, differentiation was even more rapid when both inducers were used simultaneously, with all cells expressing maximal levels of procyclin within 3 h."
1593,Adenosine transporters in bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei: substrate recognition motifs and affinity for trypanocidal drugs.,10.1124/mol.56.6.1162,1999-11-26,[],"Adenosine influx by Trypanosoma brucei brucei P1 and P2 transporters was kinetically characterized. The P1 transporter displayed a higher affinity and capacity for adenosine (K(m) = 0.38 +/- 0.10 microM, V(max) = 2.8 +/- 0.4 pmol x 10(7) cells(-1) x s(-1)) than the P2 transporter (K(m) = 0.92 +/- 0.06 microM, V(max) = 1.12 +/- 0.08 4 pmol x 10(7) cells(-1) x s(-1)). To formulate a structure-activity relationship for the interaction of adenosine with the transporters, a series of analogs were evaluated as potential inhibitors of adenosine transport, and the K(i) values were converted to binding energy. The P1 transporter was found to be selective inhibited by purine nucleosides (K(i) approximately 1 microM for inosine and guanosine), but nucleobases and pyrimidines had little effect on P1-mediated transport. The P1 transporter appears to form hydrogen bonds with N3 and N7 of the purine ring as well as with the 3' and 5' hydroxyl groups of the ribose moiety, with apparent bond energies of 12.8 to 15.8 kJ/mol. The P2 transporter, in contrast, had high-affinity (K(i) = 0.2-4 microM) for 6-aminopurines, including adenine, 2'-deoxyadenosine, and tubercidin, but not for any oxopurines. The main interaction of adenosine with the P2 transporter is suggested to be via hydrogen bonds to N1 and the 6-amino group. Additional pi-pi interactions of the purine ring and electrostatic interactions with N9 may also be important. The predicted substrate recognition motif of P2, but not of P1, corresponds to parts of the melaminophenylarsenical and diamidine molecules, confirming the potent inhibition observed with these trypanocides for P2-mediated adenosine transport (K(i) = 0.4-2.4 microM)."
1594,Interferon-gamma and interleukin-12 genes are preferentially expressed during early experimental African trypanosomiasis and suppressed by denervation of the spleen.,10.1046/j.1365-3083.1999.00639.x,1999-11-17,[],"The cross talk between the central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system includes among others, the modulation of immune responses by the autonomic nervous system. Here, we investigated the effects of a splenic denervation on cytokine induction in early experimental African trypanosomiasis. Profiles of the cytokine mRNA expression for interleukin (IL)-4, interleukin (IL)-6, interleukin (IL)-10, interleukin (IL)-12, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-beta, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and interferon (IFN)-gamma were examined at 4 h, 8 h and 12 h postinfection (p.i.), and in noninfected controls. Only IFN-gamma and IL-12 were significantly expressed over noninfected controls. Already at 4 h p.i. both cytokines were expressed and showed more increased levels at 12 h. Sympathetic denervation of the spleen markedly reduced the mRNA expression for both IFN-gamma and IL-12. Con A was used as a positive control and showed an enhanced mRNA expression, which was also suppressed by a splenic denervation. To demonstrate that the mRNA expression had resulted in a cytokine production, we looked for the protein level of IFN-gamma at 4 h p.i. by immunohistochemistry and found increased levels of IFN-gamma, which was also inhibited by the denervation. Sham-operated animals exhibited similar responses as the nondenervated controls. Our data present for the first time very early kinetics for a cytokine gene expression during an experimental African trypanosomiasis. Furthermore, the data suggest a regulatory role for the autonomic nervous system on cytokine responses at both the mRNA and the protein levels."
1595,Analysis of the kinetics of reversible enzyme inhibition by a general algebraic method. Application to multisite inhibition of the phosphoglycerate kinase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.3109/14756369809036544,1999-10-16,[],"The action of an inhibitor on a stationary enzyme reaction is described by a simple equation, which reflects how the progressive binding of inhibitor molecules influences the existence and the productivity of the enzyme forms. This allows deduction of the structure of the enzyme system from the experimental results, using new type of plots (1/[I], 1/[I](a)v) where a = 0,1,2,... in complement to the usual graphs. A reaction scheme is thereby logically built. This method may be used without any theoretical calculation. It is valid whatever the inhibitor, when the association reactions of the substrates and the inhibitor to the enzyme are in rapid equilibrium, and with dead end inhibitors, more generally for steady state enzyme reactions. This method may be adapted to enzyme activation. An original inhibition mode is described with particular bifunctional molecules: cooperative binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme, outside the active site, by direct mutual interaction of two inhibitor molecules, and locking of the conformational changes that normally precede the release of the products."
1596,"Lysine-69 plays a key role in catalysis by ornithine decarboxylase through acceleration of the Schiff base formation, decarboxylation, and product release steps.",10.1021/bi9906221,1999-10-08,[],"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent (PLP) enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of the polyamine putrescine. Similar to other PLP-dependent enzymes, an active site Lys residue forms a Schiff base with PLP in the absence of substrate. The mechanistic role of this residue (Lys-69) in catalysis by Trypanosoma brucei ODC has been studied by analysis of the mutant enzymes, in which Lys-69 has been replaced by Arg (K69R ODC) and Ala (K69A ODC). Analysis of K69A ODC demonstrated that the enzyme copurified with amines (e.g. putrescine) that were tightly bound to the active site through a Schiff base with PLP. In contrast, on the basis of an absorption spectrum of K69R ODC, PLP is likely to be bound to this mutant enzyme in the aldehyde form. Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the reaction of K69R ODC with L-Orn and putrescine demonstrated that the rates of both the product release (k(off.Put) = 0.0041 s(-)(1)) and the decarboxylation (k(decarb) = 0.016 s(-)(1)) steps were decreased by10(4)-fold in comparison to wild-type ODC. Further, the rates of Schiff base formation between K69R ODC and either substrate or product have decreased by at least 10(3)-fold. Product release remains as the dominant rate-limiting step in the reaction (the steady-state parameters for K69R ODC are k(cat) = 0.0031 s(-)(1) and K(m) = 0.18 mM). The effect of mutating Lys-69 on the decarboxylation step suggests that Lys-69 may play a role in the proper positioning of the alpha-carboxylate for efficient decarboxylation. K69R ODC binds diamines and amino acids with higher affinity than the wild-type enzyme; however, Lys-69 does not mediate substrate specificity. Wild-type and K69R ODC have similar ligand specificity preferring to bind putrescine over longer and shorter diamines. Kinetic analysis of the binding of a series of diamines and amino acids to K69R ODC suggests that noncovalent interactions in the active site of K69R ODC promote selective ligand binding during Schiff base formation."
1597,Interleukin 4 is a crucial cytokine in controlling Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection in mice.,10.1016/s0304-4017(99)00143-0,1999-10-08,[],"The role of interleukin 4 (IL-4) was studied in relation to host defense during Trypanosoma brucei gambiense IL3253 (IL3253) infection in mice. BALB/c/A-+/+ (BALB/c), BALB/c/A-nu/nu (nude) and C.B-17/Icr-scid/scid (SCID) mice were infected intraperitoneally with 5 x 10(3) bloodstream forms (BSFs) of the trypanosome. The BALB/c mice showed high resistance to IL3253 infection with sporadic parasitemia. The nude mice were also able to control IL3253 infection and experienced low, but persistent parasitemia. However, the SCID mice, which have no functional T- and B-cells, showed high susceptibility to IL3253 infection with more than 1 x 10(8) BSFs/ml. Serum IL-4 levels in the infected BALB/c mice were increased on days 12-18 post-infection (PI). In BALB/c mice depleted of CD4+ T-cells by monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment, parasitemia was persistent, ranging from 1 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(6) BSFs/ml and was significantly higher than that of the other groups. IL-4 was not detected in the serum of CD4+ T-cells-depleted mice. On the other hand, anti-IL-4-treated IL3253-infected BALB/c mice relapsed significantly longer than the control mice (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that the CD4+ T-cells may control the levels of parasitemia in IL3253 infection through the IL-4 pathway."
1598,Roles of Gln81 and Cys80 in catalysis by glycosylphosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00690.x,1999-09-22,[],"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (GPtdIns-PLC) is found in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. A region of protein sequence similarity exists between the protozoan enzyme and eubacterial phosphatidylinositol-phospholipases C. The functional relevance of Cys80 and Gln81 of GPtdIns-PLC, both in this region, was tested with a panel of mutations at each position. Gln81Glu, Gln81Ala, Gln81Gly, Gln81Lys and Gln81Leu mutants were inactive. Cleavage of GPtdIns was detectable in Gln81Asn, although the specific activity decreased 500-fold, and kcat was reduced 50-fold. Thus an amide side-chain at residue 81 is essential for catalysis by GPtdIns-PLC. Sulfhydryl reagents inactivate GPtdIns-PLC, suggesting that a Cys could be close to the enzyme active site. Surprisingly, p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate (p-CMPS) is significantly more potent than N-ethylmaleimide, the less bulky compound. This knowledge prompted us to test whether replacement of Cys80 with an amino acid possessing a bulky side-chain would inactivate GPtdIns-PLC: Cys80Ala, Cys80Thr, Cys80Phe, Cys184Ala, and Cys269-270-273Ser were constructed for that purpose. Cys80Phe lacked enzyme activity, while Cys80Ala, Cys80Thr and Cys269-270-273Ser retained 33 to 100% of wild-type activity. Interestingly, the Cys80Ala and Cys80Thr mutants became resistant to p-CMPS, as predicted if the sulfhydryl reagent reacted with Cys80 in the wild-type enzyme to form a cysteinyl mercurylphenylsulfonate moiety, a bulky adduct that inactivated GPtdIns-PLC, similar to the Cys80Phe mutation. We conclude that a bulky side-chain (or adduct) at position 80 of GPtdIns-PLC abolishes enzyme activity. Together, these observations place Cys80 and Gln81 at, or close to, the active site of GPtdIns-PLC from T. brucei."

The import of nuclearly encoded tRNAs into the mitochondrion has been demonstrated in a variety of organisms and is essential for proper function in the mitochondrion. An in vitro import assay has been developed to study the pathway of tRNA import in T. brucei. The in vitro system utilizes crude isolated trypanosome mitochondria and synthetic RNAs transcribed from a cloned nucleus-encoded tRNA gene cluster. The substrate, composed of tRNA(Ser) and tRNA(Leu), is transcribed in tandem with a 59-nucleotide intergenic region. The tandem tRNA substrate is imported rapidly, while the mature-size tRNA(Leu) fails to be imported in this system. These results suggest that the preferred substrate for tRNA import into trypanosome mitochondria is a precursor molecule composed of tandemly linked tRNAs. Import of the tandem tRNA substrate requires (i) a protein component that is associated with the surface of the mitochondrion, (ii) ATP pools both outside and within the mitochondrion, and (iii) a membrane potential. Dissipation of the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane by treatment with an uncoupling agent inhibits import of the tandem tRNA substrate. Characterization of the import requirements indicates that mitochondrial RNA import proceeds by a pathway including a protein component associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane, ATP-dependent steps, and a mitochondrial membrane potential."
1601,Catabolism of proline by procyclic culture forms of Trypanosoma congolense.,10.1016/s0305-0491(99)00040-1,1999-07-30,[],"The effect of various metabolic inhibitors on the rate of oxygen consumption by procyclic culture forms of Trypanosoma congolense utilizing proline as substrate was investigated. Cyanide inhibited the rate of oxygen consumption by 81.0 +/- 6.7%, malonate inhibited the rate by 51.6 +/- 1.6% and Antimycin A by 73.1 +/- 5.9%. A combination of cyanide and malonate inhibited the rate of oxygen consumption by 84.9 +/- 6.7% while a combination of antimycin A and malonate inhibited the rate by 81.6 +/- 7.6%. Rotenone had no effect on the rate of respiration except when the intact cells were first permeabilized by digitonin after which rotenone decreased the rate of respiration by 20-30%. Salicylhydroxamate (SHAM) did not have any effect on the rate of oxygen consumption. Enzymes involved in the catabolism of proline with high activities were: proline dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, fumarase, NADP-linked malic enzyme, alanine aminotransferase and malate dehydrogenase. Activities of 1-pyrroline-5 carboxylate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase and NAD-linked malic enzyme were detectable but lower. The end products of proline catabolism were alanine and glutamate. Unlike the case in Trypanosoma brucei brucei aspartate was not detected. Possible pathways of proline catabolism in procyclic culture forms of T. congolense and of electron transfer are proposed."
1603,Histidine-phosphorylation of succinyl CoA synthetase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/s0166-6851(99)00025-0,1999-06-22,[],"The insect form of Trypanosoma brucei depends on respiration for its energy requirements. It contains a fully functional mitochondrion with a complete citric acid cycle. Most of its enyzmes have been characterized to date. The current study presents the characterization of the histidine phosphorylation activity of one of the few remaining enzymes, succinyl CoA synthetase. The trypanosomal enyzme was identified by partial purification, followed by direct protein sequencing. It is rapidly phosphorylated, presumably through auto-phosphorylation, using either ATP or GTP as phosphate donors. The phosphorylation occurs exclusively on histidine residues. The histidine-bound phosphate can be donated to suitable phosphate acceptors in a rapid reaction. This phosphotransfer reaction is highly nucleotide selective, as only ADP, but none of the other nucleoside-diphosphates tested, can be used as a phosphate acceptor."
1604,Trypanosoma brucei spp. development in the tsetse fly: characterization of the post-mesocyclic stages in the foregut and proboscis.,10.1017/s0031182099004217,1999-06-11,[],"Post-mesocyclic development of Trypanosoma brucei in the tsetse fly in its migration from midgut to salivary glands, was revisited by sequential microdissection, morphometry and DNA-cytofluorometry. This development started by day 6 after the infective feed, with passage of mesocyclic midgut trypomastigotes through proventriculus and upward migration along foregut and proboscis to the salivary gland ducts. Kinetics of salivary gland infection showed that colonization of the salivary glands by epimastigotes occurred only during the time-limited presence of this developmental phase in the foregut and proboscis. Post-mesocyclic trypanosomes in the foregut and proboscis were pleomorphic, with 4 morphological stages in various constant proportions and present all through from proventriculus up to the salivary gland ducts: 67% long trypomastigotes, 27% long epimastigotes, 4% long epimastigotes undergoing asymmetric cell division and 2% short epimastigotes. Measurements of DNA content demonstrated a predominant tetraploidy for 67% of these trypanosomes, the remainder consisting of the homogeneous diploid short epimastigotes and some long epimastigotes. According to the experimental data, the following sequence of trypanosome differentiation in the foregut and proboscis is proposed as the most obvious hypothesis. Incoming mesocyclic trypomastigotes (2N) from the ectoperitrophic anterior midgut start to replicate DNA to a 4N level, are arrested at this point, and differentiate into the long epimastigote (4N) which give rise, by an asymmetric cell division, to 2 unequal, diploid daughter cells: a long, probably dead-end long epimastigote and a short epimastigote. The latter is responsible for the epimastigote colonization of the salivary glands if launched at the vicinity of the gland epithelium by the asymmetric dividing epimastigote."
1605,"A highly selective, high-affinity transporter for uracil in Trypanosoma brucei brucei: evidence for proton-dependent transport.",10.1139/bcb-76-5-853,1999-06-03,[],"The presence of an uptake mechanism for uracil in procyclic forms of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei was investigated. Uptake of [3H]uracil at 22 degrees C was rapid and saturable and appeared to be mediated by a single high-affinity transporter, designated U1, with an apparent Km of 0.46 +/- 0.09 microM and a Vmax of 0.65 +/- 0.08 pmol x (10(7) cells)(-1) x s(-1). [3H]Uracil uptake was not inhibited by a broad range of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleobases (concentrations up to 1 mM), with the exception of uridine, which acted as an apparent weak inhibitor (Ki value of 48 +/- 15 microM). Similarly, most chemical analogues of uracil, such as 5-chlorouracil, 3-deazauracil, and 2-thiouracil, had little or no affinity for the U1 carrier. Only 5-fluorouracil was found to be a relatively potent inhibitor of uracil uptake (Ki = 3.2 +/- 0.4 microM). Transport of uracil was independent of extracellular sodium and potassium gradients, as replacement of NaCl in the assay buffer by N-methyl-D-glucamine, KCl, LiCl, CsCl, or RbCl did not affect initial rates of transport. However, the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone inhibited up to 70% of [3H]uracil flux. These data show that uracil uptake in T. b. brucei procyclics is mediated by a single high-affinity transporter with high substrate selectivity and are consistent with a nucleobase-H+-symporter model for this carrier."
1611,Cysteine proteinase inhibitors kill cultured bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1006/expr.1998.4386,1999-03-27,[],"Trypanosoma brucei brucei is a causative agent of bovine trypanosomiasis (nagana), a disease of considerable economic significance in much of Africa. Here we report investigations on the effects of various irreversible cysteine proteinase inhibitors, including vinyl sulfones (VS), peptidyl chloromethylketones (CMK), diazomethylketones, and fluoromethyl ketones, on the major lysosomal cysteine proteinase (trypanopain-Tb) of T. b. brucei and on in vitro-cultured bloodstream forms of the parasite. Many of the tested inhibitors were trypanocidal at low micromolar concentrations. Methylpiperazine urea-Phe-homoPhe-VS was the most effective trypanocidal agent, killing 50% of test populations at a work ing concentration of 0.11 microM, while carbobenzoxy-Phe-Phe-CMK was the most trypanocidal of the methylketones with an IC50 of 3.6 microM. Labelling of live and lysed T. b. brucei with biotinylated inhibitor derivatives suggests that trypanopain-Tb is the likely intracellular target for these inhibitors. Kinetic analysis of the inhibition of purified trypanopain-Tb by the inhibitors showed that most had kass values in the 10(6) M-1 s-1 range. We conclude that cysteine proteinase inhibitors have potential as trypanocidal agents and that a major target of these compounds is the lysosomal enzyme trypanopain-Tb."
1612,Kinetics of S-adenosylmethionine cellular transport and protein methylation in Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.,10.1006/abbi.1999.1098,1999-03-24,[],"African trypanosomes of the Trypanosoma brucei group are agents of disease in man and animals. They present unique biochemical characteristics such as the need for preformed purines and have extensive salvage mechanisms for nucleoside recovery. In this regard we have shown that trypanosomes have a dedicated transporter for S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a key metabolite in transmethylation reactions and polyamine synthesis. In this study we compared the apparent kinetics of AdoMet transport, cytosolic AdoMet pool formation, and utilization of AdoMet in protein methylation reactions using two isolates: Trypanosoma brucei brucei, a veterinary parasite, and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, a human pathogen that is highly refractory and has greatly reduced susceptibility to standard trypanocidal agents active against T. b. brucei. The apparent Km values for [methyl-3H]AdoMet transport, derived by Hanes-Woolf analysis, for T. b. brucei was 4.2 and 10 mM for T. b. rhodesiense, and the Vmax values were 124 and 400 micromol/liter/min, respectively. Both strains formed substantial cytosolic pools of AdoMet, 1600 nmol/10(9) T. b. brucei and 3500 nmol/10(9) T. b. rhodesiense after 10 min incubation with 25 mM exogenous AdoMet. Data obtained from washed trichloroacetic acid precipitates of cells incubated with [methyl-3H]AdoMet indicated that the rate of protein methylation in T. b. brucei was fourfold greater than in T. b. rhodesiense. These results demonstrate that the unique rapid uptake and utilization of AdoMet by African trypanosomes is an important consideration in the design and development of new agents of potential use in chemotherapy."
1613,S-myristoylation of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.274.9.5931,1999-02-20,[],"Covalent modification with lipid can target cytosolic proteins to biological membranes. With intrinsic membrane proteins, the role of acylation can be elusive. Herein, we describe covalent lipid modification of an integral membrane glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) from the kinetoplastid Trypanosoma brucei. Myristic acid was detected on cysteine residue(s) (i.e. thiomyristoylation). Thiomyristoylation occurred both co- and post-translationally. Acylated GPI-PLC was active against variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). The half-life of fatty acid on GPI-PLC was 45 min, signifying the dynamic nature of the modification. Deacylation in vitro decreased activity of GPI-PLC 18-30-fold. Thioacylation, from kinetic analysis, activated GPI-PLC by accelerating the conversion of a GPI-PLC.VSG complex to product. Reversible thioacylation is a novel mechanism for regulating the activity of a phospholipase C."
1616,6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase: the mechanism of action investigated by a comparison of the enzyme from different species.,10.1016/s0167-4838(98)00222-2,1999-01-27,[],"The mechanism of action of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase with the alternative substrate 2-deoxy 6-phosphogluconate was investigated using enzymes from sheep liver, human erythrocytes and Trypanosoma brucei. The three enzymes oxidize 2-deoxy 6-phosphogluconate, but only the sheep liver enzyme releases the intermediate 2-deoxy,3-keto 6-phosphogluconate. Kinetic comparison showed that an increase in the rate of NADP+ reduction at high pH is due to increased release of the intermediate, rather than an increase in the overall reaction rate. 2-Deoxy,3-keto 6-phosphogluconate is decarboxylated by the erythrocyte and trypanosome enzymes but not the liver one in the absence of either NADPH or 6-phosphogluconate, which act as activators. The pH dependence of decarboxylation and the degree of activation suggest that 6-phosphogluconate is the activator which operates under normal assay conditions, while NADPH acts mainly by increasing the binding of the intermediate. The data suggest that the activity of 6PGDH is subjected to a two-way regulation: NADPH, which regulates the pentose phosphate pathway, inhibits the enzyme, while 6-phosphogluconate, levels of which rise when NADPH inhibition is removed, acts as an activator ensuring that 6-phosphogluconate is rapidly removed."
1617,An approach to use an unusual adenosine transporter to selectively deliver polyamine analogues to trypanosomes.,10.1016/s0960-894x(98)00095-x,1999-01-01,[],"In this paper we describe an approach to selectively deliver compounds to trypanosomes using an adenosine transporter which is unique to the trypanosome. Various polyamine analogues have been attached to known substrates of this adenosine transporter. The compounds prepared interact specifically with the adenosine transporter, some with a similar efficiency to berenil, a known substrate."
1618,"Cloning, expression, purification, and characterization of the acid alpha-mannosidase from Trypanosoma cruzi.",10.1093/glycob/8.12.1183,1998-12-22,[],"The acid alpha-mannosidase of Trypanosoma cruzi is a broad-specificity hydrolase involved in the catabolism of glycoconjugates, presumably in the digestive vacuole. We have cloned the alpha-mannosidase gene from a T.cruzi epimastigote genomic library. The alpha-mannosidase gene was determined to be single copy by Southern analysis, and similar sequences were not detected in genomic digests of either Trypanosoma brucei or Leishmania donovani. The coding region was subcloned into the Pichia pastoris expression vector pPICZ, and alpha-mannosidase activity was detected in the medium of induced cultures. The recombinant alpha-mannosidase demonstrated a pH optimum, inhibition by swainsonine, Km, and substrate specificity consistent with the characteristics of the alpha-mannosidase previously purified from T.cruzi epimastigotes. The recombinant enzyme was purified 103-fold from the culture medium of Pichia pastoris and had a native molecular mass of 359 kDa by gel filtration. A combination of SDS-PAGE, deglycosylation with endo H, and NH2-terminal sequencing indicates that the enzyme is originally synthesized as a homodimeric polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved to form a heterotetramer composed of 57 and 46 kDa subunits. A polyclonal antibody raised to the recombinant enzyme was shown to immunoprecipitate the alpha-mannosidase from T.cruzi cell extracts and will be used in future immunolocalization studies."
1619,Allosteric regulation of Trypanosoma brucei ribonucleotide reductase studied in vitro and in vivo.,10.1074/jbc.273.51.34098,1998-12-16,[],"Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent for African sleeping sickness. We have made in vitro and in vivo studies on the allosteric regulation of the trypanosome ribonucleotide reductase, a key enzyme in the production of dNTPs needed for DNA synthesis. Results with the isolated recombinant trypanosome ribonucleotide reductase showed that dATP specifically directs pyrimidine ribonucleotide reduction instead of being a general negative effector as in other related ribonucleotide reductases, whereas dTTP and dGTP directed GDP and ADP reduction, respectively. Pool measurements of NDPs, NTPs, and dNTPs in the cultivated bloodstream form of trypanosomes exposed to deoxyribonucleosides or inhibited by hydroxyurea confirmed our in vitro allosteric regulation model of ribonucleotide reductase. Interestingly, the trypanosomes had extremely low CDP and CTP pools, whereas the dCTP pool was comparable with that of other dNTPs. The trypanosome ribonucleotide reductase seems adapted to this situation by having a high affinity for the CDP/UDP-specific effector dATP and a high catalytic efficiency, Kcat/Km, for CDP reduction. Thymidine and deoxyadenosine were readily taken up and phosphorylated to dTTP and dATP, respectively, the latter in a nonsaturating manner. This uncontrolled uptake of deoxyadenosine strongly inhibited trypanosome proliferation, a valuable observation in the search for new trypanocidal nucleoside analogues."
1620,Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-dependent secretory transport in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1042/bj3350681,1998-10-31,[],"We have investigated the role of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors in forward secretory trafficking using African trypanosomes as a model system. Soluble GPI-minus forms of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), in which the C-terminal GPI-addition peptide signal is deleted, are secreted from transformed procyclic trypanosomes with 5-fold reduced kinetics, relative to matched GPI-anchored constructs. Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence localization studies indicate that the GPI-minus VSG reporters accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This transport defect is specific, since overexpression of GPI-minus VSG has no effect on the rate of transport of a second soluble secretory reporter (BiPN) when co-expressed in the same cells. Two results suggest that delayed forward transport cannot be accounted for by failure to fold/assemble in the absence of a GPI anchor, thereby leading to prolonged association with ER quality-control machinery. First, no evidence was found for elevated association of GPI-minus VSG with the ER molecular chaperone, BiP. Secondly, newly synthesized GPI-minus VSG is dimerized efficiently, as judged by velocity-sedimentation analysis. GPI-dependent transport is not confined to the VSG reporters, because a similar dependence is found with another trypanosomal GPI-anchored protein, trans-sialidase. These findings suggest that GPI structures act in a positive manner to mediate efficient forward transport of some, and perhaps all, GPI-anchored proteins in the early secretory pathway of trypanosomes. Possible mechanisms for GPI-dependent transport are discussed with respect to current models of vesicular trafficking."
1621,Carbon-13 isotope effect studies of Trypanosoma brucei ornithine decarboxylase.,10.1021/bi981154i,1998-10-21,[],"Carbon isotope effect studies were undertaken with the wild-type pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) from Trypanosoma brucei and with several active site mutants of the enzyme. For the decarboxylation of the optimal substrate, L-ornithine, by wild-type ODC, the observed carbon isotope effect (k12/k13) is 1.033 at pH 7.3. In comparison to the expected intrinsic isotope effect (k12/k13 = 1.06) for decarboxylation, this value suggests that both the rate of decarboxylation and the rate of Schiff base interchange with L-ornithine are partially rate-limiting for the reaction steps up to decarboxylation. In contrast, with the alternate substrate L-Lys, which shows lower catalytic efficiency, the carbon isotope effect increased to 1.063, demonstrating that decarboxylation has become the rate-limiting step. For the mutant enzymes, E274A ODC and C360A ODC, with L-ornithine as substrate the carbon isotope effect also approaches the intrinsic limit. Glu-274 was previously demonstrated to play a direct role in carbanion stabilization, and thus the large carbon isotope effect (k12/k13 = 1.055) is consistent with an impaired rate of decarboxylation compared to wild-type ODC. In contrast, for K69A ODC, the isotope effect is almost entirely suppressed, suggesting that Schiff-base formation (which now must occur from enzyme-bound PLP, rather than from an enzyme-bound PLP-Schiff base) has become rate-determining."
1622,Trypanosoma brucei gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. Characterization of the kinetic mechanism and the role of Cys-319 in cystamine inactivation.,10.1074/jbc.273.41.26317,1998-10-03,[],"The parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei utilizes a conjugate of glutathione and spermidine, termed trypanothione, in place of glutathione to maintain cellular redox balance. The first committed step in the biosynthesis of glutathione and thereby trypanothione, is catalyzed by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS). We have determined the kinetic mechanism for T. brucei gamma-GCS. The kinetics are best described by a rapid equilibrium random ter-reactant mechanism, in which the model derived Kd values for the binding of L-Glu, L-alpha-aminobutyrate, and ATP to free enzyme are 2.6, 5.1, and 1.4 mM, respectively. However, significant dependences exist between the binding of some of the substrate pairs. The binding of either ATP or L-Glu to the enzyme increases the binding affinity of the other by 18-fold, whereas the binding of L-Glu or L-alpha-aminobutyrate decreases the binding affinity of the other by 6-fold. Similarly to the mammalian enzyme, cystamine is a time-dependent, irreversible inhibitor of T. brucei gamma-GCS. It has been suggested by several studies that cystamine labels an active site Cys residue essential for catalysis. Among the enzymes reported to be inactivated by cystamine, only one Cys residue is invariant (Cys-319 in T. brucei gamma-GCS). Mutation of Cys-319 to Ala in T. brucei gamma-GCS renders the enzyme insensitive to cystamine inactivation without significantly affecting the enzyme's catalytic efficiency, kinetic mechanism, or substrate affinities. These studies suggest that cystamine inactivates the enzyme by blocking substrate access to the active site and not by labeling an essential active site residue."
1624,Phospholipase cleavage of glycosylphosphatidylinositol reconstituted in liposomal membranes.,10.1016/s0014-5793(98)00853-9,1998-08-28,[],"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) purified from rat liver lipids was incorporated into lipid bilayers of defined compositions, in the form of large unilamellar vesicles. The GPI concentration in the bilayers was kept constant at 25 mole%, whereas the remaining lipids being phosphatidylcholine, phosphastidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin and/or cholesterol were varied. The resulting liposomes consisted of spherical vesicles, approximately 100 nm in diameter, that could keep their aqueous contents separated from the extravesicular medium. When these liposomes were treated with either Bacillus cereus phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C, Trypanosoma brucei GPI-phospholipase C, or bovine serum GPI-phospholipase D, GPI was hydrolyzed at different rates, depending on the enzyme and the bilayer lipid composition. These observations open the way to biophysical and biochemical studies of enzymic GPI cleavage under defined conditions. Extensive GPI hydrolysis was observed in certain cases that could allow the use of these systems for the preparation of inositol phosphoglycans, proposed second messengers of a wide variety of hormones, cytokines and growth factors."
1625,Murine macrophages use oxygen- and nitric oxide-dependent mechanisms to synthesize S-nitroso-albumin and to kill extracellular trypanosomes.,10.1128/IAI.66.9.4068-4072.1998,1998-08-26,[],"Reactive nitrogen intermediates were synthesized spontaneously in cultures of macrophages from Trypanosoma brucei brucei-infected mice by an inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase. This was inhibited by the addition of nitro-L-arginine. In this paper, we report the kinetics of the fixation of macrophage-derived NO on bovine serum albumin by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. S nitrosylation was confirmed by the Saville reaction, using mercuric chloride. It is known that reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) are also synthesized by stimulated macrophages. The fact that NO is able to bind cysteine only under aerobic conditions led us to investigate the role of macrophage-derived ROI in the formation of S-nitrosylated proteins by activated macrophages. The immunoenzymatic signal decreased by 66 and 30% when superoxide dismutase and catalase, respectively, were added to the culture medium of macrophages from infected mice. In addition, the decrease in S-nitrosylated albumin formation correlated with the protection of extracellular trypanosomes from the cytostatic and cytotoxic activity of NO. Melatonin, a hydroxyl radical scavenger resulting from the decomposition of peroxynitrous acid, had no effect. All these data support the concept that an interaction between NO and ROI promoted the production of S-nitroso-albumin by activated macrophages from infected mice."
1628,Structure/function relationship studies on the T/S residues 173-177 of rat ODC.,10.1016/s0167-4838(98)00090-9,1998-07-24,[],"A well-conserved T/S cluster was detected among vertebrate ornithine decarboxylase by computer analysis (E. Viguera, O. Trelles, J.L. Urdiales, J.M. Matés, F. Sánchez-Jiménez, Trends Biochem. Sci. 19 (1994) 318-319). In the present report we studied the role of these residues (173, 176 and 177 in rat ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)) in enzymic activity and stability by in vitro expression, kinetic characterization and in vitro degradation of site-directed mutants. These T/S residues are substituted by a D/E-enriched fragment in other lower eukaryotic ODCs. The substitution of the T/S-enriched fragment (TLKTS) of rat ODC by the negative charged fragment of T. brucei ODC (KVEDC) did not affect protein stability, but increased Km values of the mutant enzyme. The substitution of the T/S residues by alanine also has a similar effect on rat ODC kinetic values. However, results indicate that polarity of the fragment must be an important factor for protein conformation, since the latter mutant, having no T/S or D/E residue in the fragment (ALKAA), showed reduced stability in vitro."
1630,Characterization of a nucleoside/proton symporter in procyclic Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1074/jbc.273.16.9486,1998-05-23,[],"Adenosine transport at 22 degrees C in procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei was investigated using an oil-inhibitor stop procedure for determining initial rates of adenosine uptake in suspended cells. Adenosine influx was mediated by a single high affinity transporter (Km 0.26 +/- 0.02 microM, Vmax 0.63 +/- 0.18 pmol/10(7) cells s-1). Purine nucleosides, with the exception of tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine), and dipyridamole inhibited adenosine influx (Ki 0.18-5.2 microM). Purine nucleobases and pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleobases had no effect on adenosine transport. This specificity of the transporter appears to be similar to the previously described P1 adenosine transporter in bloodstream forms of trypanosomes. Uptake of adenosine was Na+-independent, but ionophores reducing the membrane potential and/or the transmembrane proton gradient (monitored with the fluorescent probes bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbituric acid)-trimethine oxonol and 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester, respectively) inhibited adenosine transport. Similarly, an increase in extracellular pH from 7.3 to 8.0 reduced adenosine influx by 30%. A linear correlation was demonstrated between the rate of adenosine transport and the protonmotive force. Adenosine uptake was accompanied by a proton influx in base-loaded cells and was also shown to be electrogenic. These combined results indicate that transport of adenosine in T. brucei brucei procyclics is protonmotive force-driven and strongly suggest that the adenosine transporter functions as an H+ symporter."
1633,Sequence analysis of the tryparedoxin peroxidase gene from Crithidia fasciculata and its functional expression in Escherichia coli.,10.1074/jbc.273.9.4864,1998-03-28,[],"Tryparedoxin peroxidase from Crithidia fasciculata is an essential component of the trypanothione-dependent hydroperoxide metabolism in the trypanosomatids (Nogoceke, E., Gommel, D. U., Kiebeta, M., Kalisz, H. M., and Flohé, L. (1997) Biol. Chem. 378, 827-836). The tryparedoxin peroxidase gene and its flanking regions have been isolated and sequenced from a C. fasciculata genomic DNA library. It consists of an open reading frame of 564 base pairs encoding a protein of 188 amino acid residues. The gene, modified to encode 6 additional histidine residues, was expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity by metal chelating chromatography. Recombinant tryparedoxin peroxidase has a subunit molecular mass of 21884 +/- 22 and contains two isoforms of pI 6.2 and 6.3. It exhibits a kinetic pattern identical to that of the authentic tryparedoxin peroxidase and has a similar specific activity of 2.51 units mg-1. The enzyme unequivocally belongs to the peroxiredoxin family of proteins, whose members have been found in all phyla. A phylogenetic tree comprising 47 protein and DNA sequences showed tryparedoxin peroxidase and a homologous Trypanosoma brucei sequence to form a distinct molecular clade.

1634,Cell density triggers slender to stumpy differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms in culture.,10.1016/s0166-6851(97)00160-6,1998-03-13,[],"Differentiation from replicating slender forms to non-dividing stumpy bloodstream forms of T. brucei limits the parasite population size in the mammalian host in addition to and independently of the antibody response. Using a culture system for pleomorphic strains of T. brucei we show that slender forms very efficiently differentiate to stumpy forms in vitro and that the induction of differentiation is correlated to cell density. Differentiation in the host and in culture were compared using a battery of markers including cell morphology and volume, cell cycle position, the kinetics of the differentiation, expression of NADH dehydrogenase (diaphorase), expression of several differentially regulated transcripts and the kinetics of transformation to replicating procyclic forms after induction with cis-aconitate. By all available criteria, differentiation in culture reflects the natural process in the mammalian host. Time course experiments reveal a very tight temporal correlation between cell cycle arrest of bloodstream forms, appearance of a stumpy differentiation marker and the competence of a bloodstream form population to initiate transformation to procyclic forms in response to cis-aconitate. Our results show that induction of bloodstream form differentiation can occur independently of host-derived cues. We suggest a density sensing mechanism which induces differentiation to the non-dividing stumpy stage and thereby enables the parasite population to autoregulate its proliferation."
1635,Phenothiazine inhibitors of trypanothione reductase as potential antitrypanosomal and antileishmanial drugs.,10.1021/jm960814j,1998-02-11,[],"Given the role of trypanothione in the redox defenses of pathogenic trypanosomal and leishmanial parasites, in contrast to glutathione for their mammalian hosts, selective inhibitors of trypanothione reductase are potential drug leads against trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis. In the present study, the rational drug design approach was used to discover tricyclic neuroleptic molecular frameworks as lead structures for the development of inhibitors, selective for trypanothione reductase over host glutathione reductase. From a homology-modeled structure for trypanothione reductase, replaced in the later stages of the study by the X-ray coordinates for the enzyme from Crithidia fasciculata, a series of inhibitors based on phenothiazine was designed. These were shown to be reversible inhibitors of trypanothione reductase from Trypanosoma cruzi, linearly competitive with trypanothione as substrate and noncompetitive with NADPH, consistent with ping-pong bi bi kinetics. Analogues, synthesized to define structure-activity relationships for the active site, included N-acylpromazines, 2-substituted phenothiazines, and trisubstituted promazines. Analysis of Ki and I50 data, on the basis of calculated log P and molar refractivity values, provided evidence of a specially favored fit of small 2-substituents (especially 2-chloro and 2-trifluoromethyl), with a remote hydrophobic patch on the enzyme accessible for larger, hydrophobic 2-substituents. There was also evidence of an additional hydrophobic enzymic region available to suitable N-substituents of the promazine nucleus. Ki data also indicated that the phenothiazine nucleus can adopt more than one inhibitory orientation in its binding site. Selected compounds were tested for in vitro activity against Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, and Leishmania donovani, with selective activities in the micromolar range being determined for a number of them."
1636,"Molecular cloning and expression of a purine-specific N-ribohydrolase from Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Sequence, expression, and molecular analysis.",10.1074/jbc.273.4.2118,1998-01-27,[],"N-Ribohydrolases, including the inosine-adenosine-guanosine-preferring (IAG) nucleoside hydrolase, have been proposed to be involved in the nucleoside salvage pathway of protozoan parasites and may constitute rational therapeutic targets for the treatment of these diseases. Reported is the complete sequence of the Trypanosoma brucei brucei iagnh gene, which encodes IAG-nucleoside hydrolase. The 1.4-kilobase iagnh cDNA contains an open reading frame of 981 base pairs, corresponding to 327 amino acids. The iagnh gene is present as one copy/haploid genome and is located on the size-polymorphic pair of chromosome III or IV in the genome of T. b. brucei. In Southern blot analysis, the iagnh probe hybridized strongly with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, Trypanosoma evansi, Trypanosoma congolense, and Trypanosoma vivax and, to a lesser extent, with Trypanosoma cruzi genomic DNA. The iagnh gene is expressed in blood-stream forms and procyclic (insect) life-cycle stages of T. b. brucei. There are no close amino acid homologues of IAG-nucleoside hydrolase outside bacterial, yeast, or parasitic organisms. Low amino acid sequence similarity is seen with the inosine-uridine-preferring nucleoside hydrolase isozyme from Crithidia fasciculata. The T. b. brucei iagnh open reading frame was cloned into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and a soluble recombinant IAG-nucleoside hydrolase was expressed and purified to > 97% homogeneity. The molecular weights of the recombinant IAG-nucleoside hydrolase, based on the amino acid sequence and observed mass, were 35,735 and 35,737, respectively. The kinetic parameters of the recombinant IAG-nucleoside hydrolase are experimentally identical to the native IAG-nucleoside hydrolase."
1637,Differentiation of African trypanosomes is controlled by a density sensing mechanism which signals cell cycle arrest via the cAMP pathway.,10.1242/jcs.110.21.2661,1998-01-14,[],"Differentiation of African trypanosomes from replicating slender bloodstream forms to nondividing stumpy forms limits the parasite population size, allowing survival of the mammalian host and establishment of a stable host-parasite relationship. Using a novel in vitro culture system we have shown that slender to stumpy differentiation is induced by parasite density alone and thus is independent of host cues. Here we investigate the density sensing mechanism and show that trypanosomes release a soluble activity of low relative molecular mass, termed stumpy induction factor (SIF), which accumulates in conditioned medium. SIF activity triggers cell cycle arrest in G1/G0 phase and induces differentiation with high efficiency and rapid kinetics. Membrane-permeable derivates of cAMP or the phosphodiesterase inhibitor etazolate perfectly mimic SIF activity. Furthermore, SIF activity elicits an immediate two- to threefold elevation of intracellular cAMP content upon addition to slender forms. We conclude that SIF and hence density sensing operate through the cAMP signalling pathway. Temporal correlation of markers indicates that cell cycle arrest invariably precedes differentiation. Thus, our results indicate that the cell cycle regulation of bloodstream forms is under dominant control of cAMP signalling. Irreversible commitment to the quiescent state is elicited by a cAMP agonist within a period shorter than one complete cell cycle."
1638,Characterization of the reaction mechanism for Trypanosoma brucei ornithine decarboxylase by multiwavelength stopped-flow spectroscopy.,10.1021/bi971652b,1998-01-10,[],"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of polyamines. The UV-visible spectra of PLP (300-500 nm) was used to monitor the formation and breakdown of ODC reaction intermediates by multiwavelength stopped-flow spectroscopy to determine the reaction mechanism. Global kinetic analysis of the spectral data acquired after mixing ODC with saturating substrate (S) or product (P) (10 mM ornithine or 10 mM putrescine at 4 degrees C) suggests that ODC-catalyzed decarboxylation proceeds by the following reaction mechanism: ODC + S if A --> B --> C --> D --> E/F if ODC + P, where A-F are intermediates along the reaction path. Species B, which has absorbance maxima of 350 and 450 nm, is spectrally distinct from the other intermediates. On the basis of the calculated spectral characteristics, species B is likely to represent a quinoid intermediate which would be formed directly upon decarboxylation of ornithine. Thus, the data suggest that the reaction proceeds via formation of a Schiff base intermediate (species A) during the dead time of the stopped-flow instrument, followed by formation of a quinoid intermediate with a rate constant of 21 s-1. The quinoid intermediate decays in two steps (with rates of 145 and 1.0 s-1, respectively) to a Schiff base with putrescine (species D). Protonation of the Calpha carbon is required for the formation of species D, suggesting that the first of these events represents this step. The decay of species D to free enzyme and product occurs via a minimum of two intermediates and at an overall rate constant of 1-3 s-1. By comparison to the steady-state turnover number (kcat = 0.5 s-1 at 4 degrees C), these data identify product release as a rate-determining step in the overall reaction."
1639,Conformation of the trypanocidal pharmaceutical suramin in its free and bound forms: transferred nuclear overhauser studies.,10.1021/bi970297m,1997-12-31,[],"Suramin is a lead compound for treatment of cancer, HIV, and trypanosomiasis. The conformations of suramin in its free form and bound to phosphoglycerate kinases from T. brucei and S. cerevisae, have been studied in aqueous solutions using nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) and transferred NOE NMR spectroscopies. The NOE data of the free drug can be accommodated by a model in which many of the single bonds of suramin are unrestricted at room temperature, consistent with molecular mechanics calculations. The angle between the naphthalene ring and the adjoining amide is essentially locked by a strong amide-sulfonate hydrogen bond into one preferred conformation. Another degree of freedom near the termini of the molecule has a rather pronounced preference, and a third exhibits a nearly perpendicular arrangement between the amide and adjacent aromatic ring. The other two degrees of freedom have weaker preferences. Molecular mechanics calculations using AMBER force field and charges on amides and sulfonates obtained from semiempirical or ab initio calculations reproduced the extent of nonplanarity but not the detailed preferences. 13C spin-lattice relaxation, proton NOE, and light-scattering measurements for free suramin indicate that the correlation time of the molecule is approximately 3 ns at 5 mM concentration, suggesting that suramin is multimeric. Lowering the temperature to 5 degrees C causes a dramatic broadening of all of the resonances in the NMR spectra of 5 mM suramin. This broadening probably is associated with further aggregation into micelles. Suramin is monomeric at 0.5 mM and room temperature, and the NOE cross-relaxation rate constants are close to the cancellation condition for a 500 MHz proton frequency; this concentration is typical of blood serum concentrations when the drug is utilized in humans. Changes in the conformational preferences for terminal degrees of freedom are observed in the bound states of suramin based upon the transferred NOE data. The data for the bound state cannot be accommodated by a symmetric conformer. Analysis of the transferred NOESY buildup curves indicates complex kinetics of binding, probably involving an electrostatically bound encounter complex. Despite the weak binding constant, the buildup curves cannot be treated as population-weighted averages of the free and bound cross-relaxation rates, and therefore complete relaxation-exchange matrix analysis has been performed to simulate the data sets."
1640,"Role of 2,6-dideoxy-2,6-diaminoglucose in activation of a eukaryotic phospholipase C by aminoglycoside antibiotics.",10.1074/jbc.272.47.29554,1997-12-31,[],"Recent emergence of microbial resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, and the documented cytotoxicity associated with their use, calls for sustained efforts at understanding the effects of the compounds on eukaryotic cells. Using a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) from the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, we demonstrate that a eukaryotic PLC can be activated 6-fold by aminoglycosides. Neomycin B protected GPI-PLC from a reduction in activity at pH 6.5, and increased the turnover number (kcat) of the enzyme. In structure-activity studies with the neomycin group, 2-deoxy-streptamine was mildly stimulatory; the concentration required to activate GPI-PLC 2-fold (SC200) was 310 microM. Neamine was 150-fold more active (SC200 = 2 microM) than 2-deoxy-streptamine, indicating that a 2,6-dideoxy-2, 6-diaminoglucose substituent at the 4-position of 2-deoxystreptamine plays an important role in activation of GPI-PLC. Ribostamycin and neomycin B also had SC200's of 2 microM, implying that the ribose group in ribostamycin is not involved in activation of GPI-PLC. These conclusions were affirmed in studies with Bacillus thuringiensis phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. A 2, 6-dideoxy-2,6-diaminoglucose substitution at the 4-OH of 2-deoxystreptamine activates the enzyme 17-fold, while a second 2, 6-dideoxy-2,6-diaminoglucose moiety on the ribose ring of ribostamycin provides an additional 3.5-fold stimulation. Possible implications of these observations for the effects of aminoglycosides on eukaryote cells are discussed."
1641,Purine nucleobase transport in bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei is mediated by two novel transporters.,10.1016/s0166-6851(97)00129-1,1997-11-19,[],"The mechanism and inhibitor sensitivity of hypoxanthine transport by bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei was investigated. The dose response curve for the inhibition of hypoxanthine transport (1 microM) by guanosine was biphasic; approximately 90% of transport activity was inhibited with a Ki value of 10.8 +/- 1.8 microM, but 10% of the activity remained insensitive to concentrations as high as 2 mM. These two components of hypoxanthine transport are defined as guanosine-sensitive (H2) and guanosine-insensitive (H3). Hypoxanthine influx by both components was saturable, but there was a marked difference in their Km values (123 +/- 15 nM and 4.7 +/- 0.9 microM for H2 and H3, respectively) although the Vmax values (1.1 +/- 0.2 and 1.1 +/- 0.1 pmol (10[7] cells)[-1] s[-1], n = 3) were similar. Hypoxanthine uptake via the H2 carrier was inhibited by purine bases and analogues as well as by some pyrimidine bases and one nucleoside (guanosine), whereas the H3 transporter was sensitive only to inhibition by purine nucleobases. H2-mediated hypoxanthine uptake was inhibited by ionophores, ion exchangers and the potential H+-ATPase inhibitors, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Measurements of the intracellular pH and membrane potential of bloodstream trypanosomes in the presence and absence of these agents established a linear correlation between protonmotive force and rate of [3H]hypoxanthine (30 nM) uptake. We conclude that hypoxanthine transport in bloodstream forms of T. b. brucei occurs by two transport systems with different affinities and substrate specificities, one of which, H2, appears to function as a H+-/hypoxanthine symporter."

This indicates that the thiol group of a cysteine residue or the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue located within 3 A and crosslinked by the reagent is essential for catalysis. Fluorescence analyses of the modified enzyme suggest that the isoindole derivative forms at the binding site of the nicotinamide moiety of NADP+. The enzymes from Trypanosoma brucei and Lactococcus lactis are also inactivated suggesting a similar three-dimensional structure in this domain. The isoindole derivative does not form with two mutants of the T. brucei enzyme (Lys185His and Lys185Leu), this allowing to identify not only the lysine but also the cysteine involved in the cross-linking. The formation of the isoindole derivative inactivates not only the oxidative decarboxylation, but also two partial reactions catalysed by the enzyme."
1644,Hypoxanthine uptake through a purine-selective nucleobase transporter in Trypanosoma brucei brucei procyclic cells is driven by protonmotive force.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.01102.x,1997-08-01,[],"The mechanism of purine nucleobase transport in procyclic cells of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei was investigated. Hypoxanthine uptake at 22 degrees C was rapid and saturable, exhibiting an apparent Km of 9.3 +/- 2.0 microM and a Vmax of 4.5 +/- 0.8 pmol x (10(7) cells)(-1) x s(-1). All the natural purine nucleobases tested (Ki 1.8-7.2 microM), as well as the purine analogues oxypurinol and allopurinol, inhibited hypoxanthine influx in a manner consistent with the presence of a single high-affinity carrier. Nucleosides and pyrimidine nucleobases had little or no effect on hypoxanthine influx. The uptake process was independent of extracellular sodium, but inhibited by ionophores inducing cytosolic acidification (carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone, nigericin, valinomycin) or membrane depolarisation (gramicidin) as well as by the adenosine triphosphatase inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Using the fluorescent dyes bisoxonol and 2',7'-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxy-fluorescein to determine membrane potential and intracellular pH (pHi), the rate of hypoxanthine uptake was shown to be directly proportional to the protonmotive force. Similarly, under alkaline extracellular conditions hypoxanthine uptake was reversibly inhibited alongside a reduction in protonmotive force. In addition, hypoxanthine accelerated the rate of pH, recovery to pH 7 after base-loading with NH4Cl, indicative of a proton influx concurrent with hypoxanthine transport. Finally, after pretreatment of cells with N-ethylmaleimide, hypoxanthine induced a slow membrane depolarisation, demonstrating that hypoxanthine transport is electrogenic. These data show that hypoxanthine uptake in T. b. brucei procyclic cells is dependent on the protonmotive force, and are consistent with a nucleobase/H+-symporter model for this transporter."
1645,Expression of bloodstream variant surface glycoproteins in procyclic stage Trypanosoma brucei: role of GPI anchors in secretion.,10.1093/emboj/16.14.4285,1997-07-16,[],"Using transformed procyclic trypanosomes, the synthesis, intracellular transport and secretion of wild-type and mutant variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) is characterized. We find no impediment to the expression of this bloodstream stage protein in insect stage cells. VSG receives a procyclic-type phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-resistant glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, dimerizes and is N-glycosylated. It is transported to the plasma membrane with rapid kinetics (t(1/2) approximately 1 h) and then released by a cell surface zinc-dependent metalloendoprotease activity, a possible homolog of leishmanial gp63. Deletion of the C-terminal GPI addition signal generates a soluble form of VSG that is exported with greatly reduced kinetics (t(1/2) approximately 5 h). Fusion of the procyclic acidic repetitive protein (PARP) GPI anchor signal to the C-terminus of the truncated VSG reporter restores both GPI addition and transport competence, suggesting that GPI anchors play a critical role in the folding and/or forward transport of newly synthesized VSG. The VSG-PARP fusion is also processed near the C-terminus by events that do not involve N-linked oligosaccharides and which are consistent with GPI side chain modification. This unexpected result suggests that GPI processing may be influenced by adjacent peptide sequence or conformation."
1646,Trypanosoma brucei: ecto-phosphatase activity present on the surface of intact procyclic forms.,10.1515/znc-1997-5-613,1997-05-01,[],"The results presented in this paper indicate that procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei possess a phosphatase activity detected in the external cell surface able to hydrolyze about 0.7 nmol.mg-1.min-1 p-nitrophenylphosphate. A faster rate of hydrolysis was observed when membrane-enriched fractions were used. This activity is weakly sensitive to 1 mM NaF, 10 mM tartrate and 10 mM levamizole but strongly inhibited by 0.1 mM vanadate. Inhibition by both NaF and vanadate have a competitive character. This phosphatase activity decreases by increasing the pH from 6.8 to 8.4, a pH range in which cell viability was maintained during at least 1 hour. In the membrane-enriched fractions this phosphatase activity showed to be an acid phosphatase. In addition, intact cells could catalyze the dephosphorylation of [32P]phosphocasein phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues."
1648,Lectin-like characteristics of recombinant human interleukin-1beta recognizing glycans of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor.,10.1074/jbc.272.16.10579,1997-04-18,[],"We found that 35S-labeled recombinant human interleukin-1beta (rhIL-1beta) binds phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-treated human placental alkaline phosphatase, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-treated trypanosome surface variant glycoproteins, and urinary uromodulin immobilized on plates or immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. The interaction between rhIL-1beta and these glycoproteins was lectin-like, since it was inhibited in the presence of specific saccharides, i.e. mannose 6-phosphate or synthetic Ac-NH.CH2.CH2. PO4--->6Manalpha1-->(+/-2Manalpha1-->+/-6Manalpha1-->) propyl at about 1 microM. On the other hand, a wide variety of compounds including biantennary sugar chains derived from these glycoproteins as well as ethanolamine phosphate, inositol phosphate, mannose 6-sulfate, mannose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, and mannitol 6-phosphate did not show any inhibitory effect at concentrations up to 1 mM. These results indicate that rhIL-1beta interacts with these glycoproteins via the mannose 6-phosphate diester of glycans on the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Furthermore, when monolayers of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells on polycarbonate filter membranes were incubated with 35S-rhIL-1beta in either the apical or basolateral chamber, 35S-interleukin-1beta was found to bind specifically to the apical membranes with a Ka value of 4.6 x 10(7) M-1, and the specific interaction was inhibited by 1 microM mannose 6-phosphate. Since the mannose 6-phosphate diester moiety exists only in the GPI glycans on plasma membranes, it was evident that interleukin-1beta can directly interact with the mannose 6-phosphate diester component of the intact glycan of GPI anchors on plasma membranes."
1649,Role of Arg-277 in the binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to Trypanosoma brucei ornithine decarboxylase.,10.1021/bi962916h,1997-04-15,[],"The pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) binding site in Trypanosoma brucei ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) has been studied by site-directed mutagenesis and spectroscopy. The beta/alpha barrel model proposed for the eukaryotic ODC structure predicts that the phosphate group of PLP is stabilized by interactions with a Gly-rich loop (residues 235-237) and by a salt bridge to Arg-277 [Grishin, N. V., Phillips, M. A., & Goldsmith, E. J. (1995) Protein Sci. 4, 1291-1304]. Mutation of Arg-277 to Ala increases the K(m) for PLP by 270-fold compared to that of wild-type ODC while reducing k(cat) by only 2-fold at pH 8. PLP binding affinity was measured directly by ultrafiltration; the K(d) for PLP is at least 20-fold higher in the mutant enzyme at pH 8. In addition, R277A ODC also has weaker binding affinities for a series of cofactor analogs than the wild-type enzyme. These results demonstrate that Arg-277 is necessary for high-affinity PLP binding by ODC. The 31P NMR spectra of ODC suggest that the phosphate is bound in a strained conformation as a dianion to both wild-type and R277A ODC. However, the 31P chemical shift for R277A ODC (6.7 ppm) is 0.5 ppm downfield from that observed for the wild-type enzyme, indicating that the environment of the enzyme-bound phosphate is altered in the mutant enzyme. The binding affinity of PLP for both wild-type and R277A ODC is weaker at high pH, corresponding to the titration of a protonated species with a pK(a) of approximately 8.5. Concomitant with these changes are a decreased k(cat) and an altered absorption spectra which arises from bound PLP. PLP bound to wild-type ODC has a 31P chemical shift and a CD signal observable over the entire tested pH range (7-9). In contrast, for R277A ODC between pH 8 and 9, the 31P chemical shift becomes solution-like and the CD signal is abolished. The data suggest that for R277A ODC the rigid PLP binding mode which characterizes the wild-type enzyme is lost at high pH. Thus, multiple interactions between the wild-type active site and PLP maintain the cofactor in a constrained conformation that is essential for efficient catalysis, tempering the consequence of the removal of any single interaction."
1650,Isozyme-specific transition state inhibitors for the trypanosomal nucleoside hydrolases.,10.1021/bi962319v,1997-03-25,[],"Protozoan parasites lack de novo purine biosynthesis and require purine salvage from the host. Nucleoside hydrolases are involved in nucleoside salvage and are not found in mammals, making them protozoan-specific targets for inhibitor design. Several protozoan nucleoside hydrolase isozymes with distinct substrate specificities have been characterized. Novel substituted iminoribitols have been synthesized to resemble the transition state structure of the nonspecific inosine-uridine nucleoside hydrolase from Crithidia fasciculata (IU-nucleoside hydrolase). These inhibitors have been characterized for this enzyme and for a purine-specific nucleoside hydrolase (IAG-nucleoside hydrolase) from Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Inhibitors which provide nanomolar inhibition constants for IU-nucleoside hydrolase exhibit micromolar inhibition constants for the IAG-enzyme. For example, p-bromophenyliminoribitol inhibits the IU- and IAG-enzymes with dissociation constants of 28 nM and 190 microM, respectively. Substrate specificity, the action of transition state inhibitors and the pH-dependence of the kinetic constants establish that the catalytic mechanisms and transition state structures are fundamentally different for the IU- and IAG-isozymes. The finding is remarkable since these isozymes share significant homology at the catalytic sites and both use inosine as a preferred substrate. The specificity of the transition state analogues indicates that logically-designed transition state inhibitors are isozyme-specific, with (Km/Ki IU-nucleoside hydrolase)/(Km/Ki IAG-nucleoside hydrolase) values up to 39,000. The mechanism of the differential inhibition is based on the relative leaving group activation and ribosyl-oxocarbenium-forming abilities of these enzymes. In addition to providing isozyme-specific inhibitors, the novel molecules described here have diagnostic value for the nature of the transition states for N-ribohydrolase enzymes."

Many of these parasites, including Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp., access host purines by phosphoribosylating purine bases via purine phosphoribosyltransferase (PRT) enzymes. The trypanosomatid hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) enzyme has been implicated as a critical enzyme of purine salvage in members of the Trypanosomatidae family. Moreover, the HGPRT enzymes of Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. can also initiate the metabolism of certain cytotoxic purine base analogs that have little effect on the mammalian host. This implies that either inhibitors or substrates of HGPRT might serve as efficacious and selective agents for the treatment of diseases for which trypanosomatids are the etiologic agent. The hgprt genes from Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania donovani have all been cloned, sequenced and overexpressed in E. coli, and the recombinant proteins have all been purified to homogeneity and characterized with respect to kinetic parameters and physicochemical properties. This paper presents an overview of recent molecular and biochemical studies on trypanosomatid HGPRT proteins and future efforts to validate HGPRT as a rational target for the chemotherapeutic manipulation of African sleeping sickness, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis."

The compound was evaluated against three isolates: Trypanosoma brucei brucei CMP, T.b. brucei GVR 35 and T.b. gambiense Feo. On the T.b. brucei GVR 35 murine CNS model, no mouse was cured when the treatment was commenced 21 days post-infection whatever the treatment regimen. Nevertheless, in vitro the compound killed the trypomastigote forms of T. b. gambiense Feo at 0.6 microM. In vivo, the compound cured all mice infected 1 hour previously with T. b. gambiense Feo after a 10 mg/kg (6.3 mumol/kg) treatment subcutaneously administered in a single dose. Moreover, the compound was active at 1 mg/kg (0.6 mumol/kg) in a single dose against the early stage of the T. b. brucei Antat 1-9 sheep model. Serum kinetics data showed that pentamidine di-(iridium cyclo-octadiene) tetraphenylborate was distributed within deep compartment according to a monocompartmental model. The maximum iridium serum concentration was 198 micrograms/l corresponding to 1 mumol/kg of iridium derivative and this value remained stable for 30-50 hours post-treatment. Iridium was completely eliminated from the serum 700 hours post-treatment. all data obtained from these models are in favour of an activity in the early stage of the disease but indicate that the compound could not cross the blood-brain barrier despite its lipophilicity. Although iterative treatments with the compound rapidly induced the selection of iridium derivative refractory populations, the compound could be studied on pentamidine refractory strains."

Substrate preparation with variant surface glycoprotein of Trypamosoma brucei, its characterization and solubilization by glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and D are reported. Hydrolysis of substrate exhibited first-order kinetics with respect to enzyme concentration, and the rate constant of the reaction is independent both from substrate concentration and reaction time. This assay was compared with the one using 3H-myristoylated variant surface glycoprotein and proved to be equally suitable to quantitate glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipases, with the advantage that avoids biosynthetic labeling. Furthermore, it introduces a basic methodology which can be easily adapted to use other glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins as substrates."

Procyclin/PARP is not expressed in bloodstream form parasites, which are coated instead with the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). Although procyclin/PARP protein is not present and the mRNA is barely detectable, procyclin/PARP genes are transcribed at this life cycle stage. We examined the mechanism for down-regulation of procyclin/PARP expression in bloodstream trypanosomes by using protein synthesis inhibitors to effect accumulation of procyclin/PARP transcripts. We show that the accumulation is not due to increased transcription of procyclin/PARP genes. Further, transcripts which accumulate under these conditions are of mature size, polyadenylated and polysome-associated indicating that normally, in bloodstream trypanosomes, down-regulation of procyclin/PARP expression is exerted either during transcript processing or at the level of mRNA stability. A comparison of the inhibitor-induced accumulation of procyclin/PARP transcripts in bloodstream forms of monomorphic and pleomorphic cell lines of trypanosome stock EATRO 795 shows that accumulation occurs with similar kinetics in both cell lines."

Kinetic analysis and inhibition by trypanocidal drugs.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.0592h.x,1996-09-15,[],"The kinetics of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma brucei was examined and compared to those of the same enzyme from lamb's liver. Variation of kinetic parameters as a function of pH suggests a chemical mechanism similar to other 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases. The comparison extended to a detailed analysis of the effect on enzyme activity by several inhibitors including the trypanocidal drugs suramin, melarsoprol and analogues of these compounds. The T. brucei enzyme differs significantly from its mammalian counterpart with respect to several inhibitors, particularly the substrate analogue 6-phospho-2-deoxygluconate and the coenzyme analogue adenosine 2',5'-bisphosphate which have respectively 170-fold and 40-fold higher affinity for the parasite enzyme."
1661,Lipid metabolism in Trypanosoma brucei: utilization of myristate and myristoyllysophosphatidylcholine for myristoylation of glycosyl phosphatidylinositols.,10.1042/bj3180575,1996-09-01,[],"Myristate is the exclusive fatty acid species in the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor of the Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). [3H]Myristate can be incorporated into T. brucei GPIs by two distinct processes known as fatty acid remodelling and myristate exchange. Myristoyllysophosphatidylcholine (M-LPC) can also serve as a myristate donor for VSG in trypanosomes [Bowes, Samad, Jiang, Weaver and Mellors (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 13885-13892]. We have studied in detail the myristoylation of GPIs using a [3H]M-LPC substrate. Labelling of VSG and free GPIs by [3H]M-LPC in cultured trypanosomes occurred at the same rate as with [3H]myristate. Concurrent with GPI labelling, there was rapid hydrolysis of [3H]M-LPC to generate extracellular [3H]myristate. Experiments in a trypanosomal cell-free system indicated that GPI labelling by fatty acid remodelling and myristate exchange was also equally efficient with [3H]M-LPC and [3H]myristate. Furthermore, both ATP and CoA are required for the myristoylation of GPIs by [3H]M-LPC. These experiments suggest that GPI myristoylation from M-LPC involves hydrolysis of M-LPC to free myristate. To address the physiological importance of myristate and M-LPC in VSG myristoylation, we radiolabelled trypanosomes in vivo with both substrates in medium containing serum, and found that [3H]myristate labelled VSG and GPIs more efficiently. Thus, VSG myristoylation by free myristate may be favoured in bloodstream trypanosome infections."
1662,"Characterization of Trypanosoma brucei gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of trypanothione (diglutathionylspermidine).",10.1074/jbc.271.29.17485,1996-07-19,[],"The parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei maintains redox balance by synthesizing a conjugate of glutathione and spermidine termed trypanothione. The first committed step in the biosynthesis of glutathione, and thereby trypanothione, is catalyzed by the enzyme gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gammaGCS). We have cloned and sequenced the 2037-base pair gene coding for the catalytic subunit of T. brucei gammaGCS. T. brucei gammaGCS appears to be encoded by a single copy gene. A transcript of about 2.3 kilobases was observed in procyclic trypomastigotes. The deduced amino acid sequence of 679 amino acids shares 45, 41, and 36% sequence identity with mammalian, Caenorhabditis elegans, and yeast gammaGCS, respectively. The T. brucei gammaGCS gene was expressed in E. coli; the purified 77.4-kDa enzyme catalyzes the ligation of L-Glu to L-Cys with a kcat of 10 s-1, confirming that the gene encodes the functional catalytic subunit of gammaGCS. The apparent Km values measured for the three natural substrates L-Glu, L-Cys, and ATP are 0.24, 0.69, and 0.07 mM, respectively. Unlike the mammalian enzyme, L-alpha-aminobutyrate (apparent Km = 10 mM) is a poor substitute for L-Cys in the T. brucei gammaGCS-catalyzed reaction. T. brucei gammaGCS is feedback-inhibited by glutathione (apparent KI = 1.1 mM), and it is inactivated by cystamine and buthionine sulfoximine. The kinetic properties of recombinant T. brucei gammaGCS suggest that the substrate binding pocket and the mechanism of enzyme regulation differ from the mammalian enzyme, providing evidence that T. brucei gammaGCS could be a selective chemotherapeutic target for the treatment of trypanosomiasis."
1664,Identification of complete precursors for the glycosylphosphatidylinositol protein anchors of Trypanosoma cruzi.,10.1074/jbc.271.28.16877,1996-07-12,[],"The survival of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, depends vitally on proteins and glycoconjugates that mediate the parasite/host interaction. Since most of these molecules are attached to the membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), alternative means of chemotherapeutic intervention might emerge from GPI biosynthesis studies. The structure of the major 1G7 antigen GPI has been fully characterized by us (Güther, M. L. S., Cardoso de Almeida, M. L., Yoshida, N., and Ferguson, M. A. J.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 6820-6828; Heise, N., Cardoso de Almeida, M. L., and Ferguson, M. A. J.(1995) Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 70, 71-84), and based on its properties we now report the complete precursor glycolipids predicted to be transferred to the nascent protein. Migrating closely to Trypanosoma brucei glycolipid A on TLC, such species, named glycolipids A-like 1 and A-like 2, were labeled with tritiated palmitic acid, myo-inositol, glucosamine, and mannose, but surprisingly only the less polar glycolipid A-like 1 incorporated ethanolamine. The predicted products following nitrous acid deamination and digestion with phospholipases A2, C, and D confirmed their GPI nature. Evidence that they may represent the anchor transferred to the 1G7 antigen came from the following analyses: (i) alpha-mannosidase treatments indicated that only one mannose was amenable to removal; (ii) their lipid moiety was identified as sn-1-alkyl-2-acylglycerol due to their sensitivity to phospholipase A2 (PLA2), mild base and by direct high performance TLC analysis of the corresponding benzoylated diradylglycerol components; and (iii) both glycolipids incorporated 3H-fatty acid only in the sn-2- and not in the sn-1-alkyl position as previously found in the GPI of the mature 1G7 antigen. Based on the differential [3H]ethanolamine incorporation pattern and the recent report that an aminoethylphosphonic acid (AEP) replaces ethanolamine phosphate (EtNH2-PO4) in the GPI in epimastigote sialoglycoproteins (Previato, J. O., Jones, C., Xavier, M. T., Wait, R., Travassos, L. R., Parodi, A. J., and Mendonça-Previato, L.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 7241-7250) it is proposed that glycolipid A-like 2 contains AEP and A-like 1 EtNH2-PO4. In the in vitro cell-free system both glycolipids were synthesized simultaneously and do not seem to bear a precursor/product relationship. Among the various components synthesized in vitro a glycolipid C-like corresponding to a form of glycolipid A-like 1 acylated on the inositol was also characterized. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, an inhibitor known to block the addition of ethanolamine phosphate in T. brucei but not in mammalian cells, also inhibits the synthesis of glycolipids A-like and C-like in T. cruzi, indicating that the putative trypanosome EtNH2-PO4/AEP transferase(s) might represent a potential target for chemotherapy."
1665,Circular dichroism assay for decarboxylation of optically pure amino acids: application to ornithine decarboxylase.,10.1006/abio.1996.0274,1996-07-01,[],"A circular dichroism (CD) assay for decarboxylation of optically pure amino acids is described. The viability of this assay is demonstrated using the Trypanosoma brucei ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)-catalyzed reaction of L-ornithine to putrescine and CO2. The results from the CD assay (kcat of 7.5 +/- 0.7 s-1 and Km 230 +/- 60 microM) were identical to the results obtained from the commercially available dye-linked assay which couples CO2 production with NADH oxidation (kcat of 7.3 +/- 0.5 s-1 and Km 320 +/- 30 microM). The CD assay has advantages over the currently used 14CO2 and dye-linked assays since it can be continuously monitored and does not contain additional enzymes. The CD assay will enable the determination of the effects of pH, ionic strength, and D2O on catalysis by ODC. Furthermore, the availability of cuvets with pathlengths from 0.01 to 100 mm provides an effective range for the CD assay from 10 microM to 2.5 M L-ornithine concentration for this assay. This technique should be generally applicable for steady-state analysis of other decarboxylases but is not easily amenable to the analysis of crude enzyme preparations."
1666,Phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis by Trypanosoma brucei glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase C.,10.1074/jbc.271.26.15533,1996-06-28,[],"Detergent-solubilized glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored structures can be cleaved by C-type phospholipases isolated from peanuts and bloodstream cells of the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei. The two enzymes differ in their reported ability to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol (PI); while the peanut enzyme readily hydrolyzes PI in vitro, the T. brucei enzyme was reported to be virtually inactive against PI and consequently named GPI-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC). In this paper, we describe experiments in which we reinvestigated the substrate specificity of T. brucei GPI-PLC by incubating the purified enzyme with Triton X-100/PI-mixed micelles and by studying PI hydrolysis. We found that PI hydrolysis occurred in a detergent-dependent fashion over the range of concentrations tested (5 microM to 1 mM PI). At 5 microM PI, hydrolysis was maximal at 0.005% Triton X-100, whereas at 1 mM PI, maximal hydrolysis required 0.05% Triton X-100. Hydrolysis of both PI and GPI was strongly affected by the presence of phospholipids. Endogenous PI was hydrolyzed during osmotic and detergent lysis of trypanosomes under conditions used to obtain quantitative hydrolysis of the GPI-anchored trypanosome variant surface glycoprotein. PI hydrolysis in the lysates was inhibited by sodium p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate but unaffected by EGTA, consistent with the proposal that hydrolysis is due to GPI-PLC. These results suggest that the function of T. brucei GPI-PLC may be to regulate PI as well as (or instead of) GPI levels."
1667,Phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C is activated allosterically by the aminoglycoside G418. 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-scyllo-inositol-1-O-dodecylphosphonate and its analogs inhibit glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase C.,10.1074/jbc.271.26.15468,1996-06-28,[],"Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from Bacillus cereus is inhibited by myo-inositol-1-O-dodecylphosphonate (Ins-1-O-dodecylphosphonate) (Morris, J. C., Ping-Sheng, L., Shen, T. Y., and Mensa-Wilmot, K.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2517-2524). A set of novel fluorinated 2-deoxy-Ins-1-O-dodecylphosphonates were tested against PI-PLC, with potent competitive inhibition by 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-scyllo-Ins-1-O-dodecylphosphonate (VP-616L) (Xi(50) = 0.09). 2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-myo-Ins-1-O-dodecylphosphonate and 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-myo-Ins-1-O-dodecylphosphonate were 8.3-fold and 4.8-fold less effective, respectively, than VP-616L. Methyl 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-myo-Ins-1-O-dodecylphosphonate was inactive. Also, a hundredfold less PI-PLC is required to cleave a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) than is needed to cleave PI. Implied in these observations are the following: (i) in powerful inhibitors an active site residue probably interacts with the equatorially oriented fluoro substituent; (ii) substrate recognition requires a negative charge on the phosphoryl at the Ins-1 position, and (iii) a GPI is better substrate than PI, for PI-PLC. Aminoglycoside antibiotics kanamycin A, gentamycin, and G418 stimulated PI-PLC cleavage of the GPI anchor of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) from Trypanosoma brucei 2- to 4-fold. G418, which appears to act on the enzyme.substrate complex, increased kcat and Km 6.4-fold and 9.9-fold, respectively. PI-PLC was activated by G418 even in the presence of the inhibitor VP-616L. In control experiments, the lectin concanavalin A (ConA), which probably acts by substrate sequestration, inhibited both PI-PLC (Xi(50) = 0.00025) and GPI-specific phospholipase D (Xi(50) = 0.00018). G418 failed to activate PI-PLC when ConA was present. These observations indicate that G418 is an allosteric activator of Bacillus cereus PI-PLC. Since G418 stimulates a purified enzyme that is not involved in aminoglycoside metabolism, we propose that binding of aminoglycosides to cellular proteins could contribute to the development of the nephrotoxicity associated with the use of these aminoglycoside antibiotics."
1668,Cloning and functional expression of glycosyltransferases from parasitic protozoans by heterologous complementation in yeast: the dolichol phosphate mannose synthase from Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1042/bj3160853,1996-06-15,[],"The gene for the enzyme dolichol phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) synthase from the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei brucei (T. brucei) was cloned by screening a T. brucei cDNA library and then sequenced. The library was constructed in a yeast expression vector and the positive clone was identified by complementation of a temperature-sensitive defect in the yeast strain DPM 1-6 [Orlean, Albright and Robbins (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 17499-17507]. The insert of this clone displayed an open reading frame of 801 nucleotides coding for a putative protein of 267 amino acids. The deduced protein sequence showed an identity of 49% and a similarity of 69% with the published yeast sequence. Additional features of the T. brucei sequence are the presence of a putative signal sequence, a C-terminal transmembrane domain, a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and a stretch of five nucleotides immediately upstream from the putative initiation codon that could function as a prokaryotic ribosome binding site. A consensus sequence for dolichol binding (FI/VXF/YXXIPFXF/Y) found in the yeast protein could not be detected in the putative transmembrane domain of the T. brucei sequence. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant protein showed that it is functionally expressed in the yeast strain DPM 1-6 and Escherichia coli. In both constructs Dol-P-Man synthesis was shown in a cell-free system. Synthesis was stimulated by exogenous dolichol phosphate and inhibited by amphomycin. These results confirm that we have cloned the T. brucei Dol-P-Man synthase by heterologous complementation in yeast, an approach that might be applicable for other glycosyltransferases from various sources."
1671,Kinetic study of the plasma-membrane potential in procyclic and bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei using the fluorescent probe bisoxonol.,10.1042/bj3140595,1996-03-01,[],"The characteristics of the plasma-membrane potential of procyclic and bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei (cultured cells) were investigated using the fluorescent anionic probe bisoxonol. Observation of a stable and representative plasma-membrane potential in the resting state required careful washing, centrifugation and maintenance of the cells at room temperature before measurement. Bloodstream forms were more prone to depolarization during washing at 4 degrees C than procyclic cells. The higher fluorescence observed in the presence of long slender cells than in the presence of procyclic cells shows that the plasma-membrane potential is more negative in the insect form. Healthy dilute cells can sustain their plasma-membrane potential for hours in the presence of external glucose. The presence of a high K+ concentration in the medium did not promote by itself the depolarization of either type of cell. Study of bisoxonol fluorescence as a function of time allowed us to follow the kinetics of the action of metabolic inhibitors in the presence of various ions. o-Vanadate (1 mM) was found to depolarize bloodstream-form cells rapidly but only in a phosphate-free NaCl buffer. Omeprazole and strophanthidin also specifically depolarized bloodstream-form trypanosomes. However, NN'-dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide depolarized both types of cell, but more rapidly for bloodstream-form cells. Bloodstream-form trypanosomes appear to use mainly a vanadate-sensitive Na+ pump to maintain their Na+-diffusion gradient. However, most of the ATPase inhibitors tested had little or no effect on the plasma-membrane potential of procyclics suggesting that this form of trypanosome may rely on several regulation mechanisms."
1672,Identification of a region of p53 that confers lability.,10.1074/jbc.271.8.4447,1996-02-23,[],"Degradation provides one means for controlling the cellular level of the p53 tumor suppressor. Here we have determined a structural element of p53 required for degradation. To create a substrate amenable to in vitro analysis of proteolysis, we appended to p53 the N terminus of antizyme, a protein that binds to and induces degradation of mammalian ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). We found using deletion analysis that an element within amino acids 100-150 is required for degradation of the fusion protein. A monoclonal antibody (PAb246) that binds close to this region prevents the degradation induced by human papillomavirus 16 E6 protein. Furthermore, we found that amino acids 100-150 of p53 can function as an independent domain to induce Trypanosoma brucei ODC, a stable protein, to be degraded in vivo or, by cooperating with an antizyme binding domain of ODC, to confer polyamine-dependent regulation."
1673,The N terminus of antizyme promotes degradation of heterologous proteins.,10.1074/jbc.271.8.4441,1996-02-23,[],"Regulated degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is mediated by its association with the inducible protein antizyme. The N terminus of antizyme (NAZ), although unneeded for the interaction with ODC, must be present to induce degradation. We report here that covalently grafting NAZ to ODC confers lability that normally results from the non-covalent association of native antizyme and ODC. To determine whether NAZ could act similarly as a modular functional domain when grafted to other proteins, we fused it to a region of cyclin B (amino acids 13-90) capable of undergoing degradation or to cyclin B (amino acids 13-59), which is not subject to degradation. The association with NAZ made both NAZ-cyclin B13-90 and NAZ-cyclin B13-59 unstable. Furthermore, NAZ and cyclin B 13-59 were together able to induce in vitro degradation of Trypanosoma brucei ODC, a stable protein. The ODC-antizyme complex bound to the 26 S protease but not the 20 S proteasome, consistent with the observation that ODC degradation is mediated by the 26 S protease. The association was shown to be independent of NAZ, suggesting that NAZ does not act as a recognition signal."
1675,Myristate exchange on the Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoprotein.,10.1073/pnas.93.3.1178,1996-02-06,[],"The glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor of the Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) is unique in having exclusively myristate as its fatty acid component. We previously demonstrated that the myristate specificity is the result of two independent pathways. First, the newly synthesized free GPI, which is not myristoylated, undergoes fatty acid remodeling to replace both its fatty acids with myristate. Second, the myristoylated precursor, glycolipid A, undergoes a myristate exchange reaction, detected by the replacement of unlabeled myristate by [3H]myristate. Remodeling and exchange have different enzymatic properties and apparently occur in different subcellular compartments. We now demonstrate that the GPI anchor linked to VSG is the major substrate for myristate exchange. VSG can be efficiently labeled with [3H]myristate by exchange in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor that prevents new VSG synthesis and thus anchor addition to protein. Not only is newly synthesized VSG subject to exchange, but mature VSG, possibly recycling from the cell surface, also undergoes myristate exchange."
1677,Import of a DHFR hybrid protein into glycosomes in vivo is not inhibited by the folate-analogue aminopterin.,10.1083/jcb.132.3.311,1996-02-01,[],"Dihydrofolate reductase fusion proteins have been widely used to study conformational properties of polypeptides translocated across membranes. We have studied the import of dihydrofolate reductase fusion proteins into glycosomes and mitochondria of Trypanosoma brucei. As signal sequences we used the last 22 carboxy-terminal amino acids of glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinase for glycosomes, and the cleavable presequences of yeast cytochrome b2 or cytochrome oxidase subunit IV for mitochondria. Upon addition of aminopterin, a folate analogue that stabilizes the dihydrofolate reductase moiety, import of the fusion protein targeted to glycosomes was not inhibited, although the results of protease protection assays showed that the fusion protein could bind the drug. Under the same conditions, import of a DHFR fusion protein targeted to mitochondria was inhibited by aminopterin. When DHFR fusion proteins targeted simultaneously to both glycosomes and mitochondria were expressed, import into mitochondria was inhibited by aminopterin, whereas uptake of the same proteins into glycosomes was either unaffected or slightly increased. These findings suggest that the glycosomes possess either a strong unfolding activity or an unusually large or flexible translocation channel."

This paper describes the synthesis and properties of the enantiomers of calmidazolium from the enantiomers of miconazole [1(N)-(2-(2,4-dichlorobenzyloxy)-2-(2,4 dichlorophenyl))-ethyl imidazole], prepared from the racemate by chiral preparative scale high performance liquid chromatography. Overlap between ligand and protein resonances in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum of the calmidazolium-calmodulin complexes has been obviated by preparation of the protein with all of its nine phenylalanine rings deuterated (Phe-d5 calmodulin). This has been accomplished by the overexpression of calmodulin derived from Trypanosoma brucei rhodiesiense in E. coli in a medium supplemented with ring-deuterated phenylalanine. The kinetics of binding of each enantiomer are slow on the 1H NMR time scale as judged by the behaviour of the H2 resonance of Histidine-107, which is clearly visible under the sample conditions used. The aromatic spectral regions of the protein-bound (+) and (-) enantiomers contrast strikingly, reflecting differences in bound environment and/or conformation."
1679,Characterization of a life-cycle-stage-regulated membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.871_a.x,1995-12-15,[],"We report the first characterization of plasma-membrane-bound tyrosine phosphatase activity in the haemoprotozoan. Trypanosoma brucei. Several enzymic properties of the membrane fraction were identical to other protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases), such as (a) insensitivity to inhibitors of other protein phosphatases, including tetramisole, sodium tartrate and okadaic acid, (b) inhibition by sodium vanadate, and (c) activation by spermidine. Additionally, T. brucei PTPase activity presented two novel features, an acidic pH optimum at pH 4.0-5.0 and a very low Km value (2.5 nM) for the specific synthetic substrate, Tyr(P)Raytide. Higher Km values of 170 nM for Tyr(P)-RCML (RCML, reduced, carboxamidomethylated and maleylated lysozyme) and of 3 mM for the non-specific inorganic substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate, suggested that the PTPase activity of T. brucei was substrate specific. Reconstitution experiments on bloodstream-stage membrane proteins revealed that three polypeptides of 148, 115 and 72 kDa contained vanadate-inhibitable PTPase activity. Modulator assays revealed that the 72-kDa protein was responsible for the observed spermidine stimulation, but indicated that the modulator profile of the 148-kDa protein was most similar to the whole membrane fraction. Furthermore, the PTPase activity of T. brucei was life-cycle-stage regulated. Neither the whole membrane fraction nor the reconstituted proteins of the procyclic insect stage dephosphorylated tyrosine residues."
1682,Characterization of the respiratory chain of Leishmania donovani promastigotes.,10.1016/0166-6851(95)02510-3,1995-12-01,[],"Inhibition analysis of respiration of Leishmania donovani promastigotes in resting, starved and permeabilized cells in the presence of classical electron transfer complex inhibitors such as rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone and antimycin demonstrated the absence of complex I component of the respiratory chain in this organism. Cyanide failed to completely block the oxygen uptake (residual 25-30%) even at high concentrations. The alternative oxidase inhibitor for Trypanosoma brucei, salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) had no effect on respiration while the cytochrome o inhibitor orthohydroxydiphenyl (OHD) could block cyanide-insensitive respiration at low concentrations. Succinate-dependent O2 uptake in permeabilized cells follows the classical pathway. Oxidation of NADH by a membrane-rich fraction produced H2O2 as the end product and was insensitive to respiratory chain inhibitors. The presence of NADH-fumarate reductase was demonstrated in membrane-rich fraction and fumarate could reduce H2O2 production from NADH indicating fumarate to be an endogenous substrate for accepting electrons from NADH. A differential route for NADH oxidation was further confirmed by NADH cytochrome c reductase insensitivity to antimycin. A tentative scheme for electron transfer pathway in this organism is proposed in which a reversal of Krebs cycle enzymes occur producing succinate that can be excreted or oxidized depending upon the energy demands of the cell. Inhibition studies also suggest bifurcations of the respiratory chain that can be of minor importance for the organism."

Since arsenical-resistant trypanosomes show cross-resistance in vivo to aromatic diamidines, we have investigated whether these drugs are also substrates for the P2 nucleoside transporter. In melarsen-sensitive T. b. brucei, the diamidines, including the commonly used trypanocides, pentamidine and berenil, were found to abrogate lysis induced by the P2 transport of melarsen oxide in vitro. Measurement of [ring-3H]pentamidine transport in melarsen-sensitive T. b. brucei, demonstrated that uptake is carrier-mediated, with a Km of 0.84 microM and a Vmax of 9.35 pmol s-1 (10(8) cells)-1. Pentamidine transport appears to be P2-mediated in these cells, as pentamidine strongly inhibited uptake of [2',5',8-3H]adenosine by the P2 transporter, with a Ki of 0.56 microM. Furthermore, [ring-3H]pentamidine transport was blocked by a number of P2 transporter substrates and inhibitors, as well as by other diamidine drugs. Analysis of the uptake of pentamidine and other diamidines in melarsen-resistant trypanosomes in vitro and in vivo, which also show differential levels of resistance to these compounds in vivo, indicated that P2 transport was altered in these cells and that accumulation of these drugs was markedly reduced."
1685,"Low temperature reversibly inhibits transport from tubular endosomes to a perinuclear, acidic compartment in African trypanosomes.",10.1242/jcs.108.11.3611,1995-11-01,[],"We have used electron microscopy and flow cytofluorimetry to study endocytosis and intracellular transport of fluid phase bovine serum albumen gold complexes and membrane bound concanavalin A through endosomal compartments of bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Both markers were rapidly endocytosed from the flagellar pocket. Within 20 minutes at 37 degrees C the markers reached a large, vesicular, perinuclear compartment that stained heavily with the CB1 monoclonal antibody. Neither marker left the flagellar pocket and entered cells at 4 degrees C. When cells were incubated at 12 degrees C, both markers entered the cell and were transported to collecting tubules, a tubular endosomal compartment that receives endocytosed material from coated endocytic vesicles. However, no material was transported from collecting tubules to the late, perinuclear compartment at 12 degrees C. The morphology of collecting tubule membranes was specifically altered at 12 degrees C; tubules became shorter and were arrayed near the flagellar pocket. The morphological alteration and the block in transport of endocytic markers to the perinuclear compartment seen at 12 degrees C were reversed 10 minutes after cells were returned to 37 degrees C. We also used flow cytofluorimetric measurements of pH dependent fluorescence quenching to measure the pH of the terminal endocytic compartment. Fluoresceinated lectins accumulated in a terminal compartment with a pH of 6.0-6.1, a value considerably higher than that of mammalian lysosomes. Fluorescence from fluoresceinated lectins in this terminal endocytic compartment was dequenched when bloodstream forms were incubated in the presence of chloroquine."
1686,Identification of haptoglobin as a natural inhibitor of trypanocidal activity in human serum.,10.1073/pnas.92.22.10262,1995-10-24,[],"Trypanosomes are protozoan parasites of medical and veterinary importance. Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infect humans, causing African sleeping sickness. However, Trypanosoma brucei brucei can only infect animals, causing the disease Nagana in cattle. Man is protected from this subspecies of trypanosomes by a toxic subtype of high density lipoproteins (HDLs) called the trypanosome lytic factor (TLF). The toxic molecule in TLF is believed to be the haptoglobin-related protein that when bound to hemoglobin kills the trypanosome via oxidative damage initiated by its peroxidase activity. The amount of lytic activity in serum varies widely between different individuals with up to a 60-fold difference in activity. In addition, an increase in the total amount of lytic activity occurs during the purification of TLF, suggesting that an inhibitor of TLF (ITLF) exists in human serum. We now show that the individual variation in trypanosome lytic activity in serum correlates to variations in the amount of ITLF. Immunoblots of ITLF probed with antiserum against haptoglobin recognize a 120-kDa protein, indicating that haptoglobin is present in partially purified ITLF. Haptoglobin involvement is further shown in that it inhibits TLF in a manner similar to ITLF. Using an anti-haptoglobin column to remove haptoglobin from ITLF, we show that the loss of haptoglobin coincides with the loss of inhibitor activity. Addition of purified haptoglobin restores inhibitor activity. This indicates that haptoglobin is the molecule responsible for inhibition and therefore causing the individual variation in serum lytic activity."
1687,Domain organization and a protease-sensitive loop in eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase.,10.1021/bi00041a021,1995-10-17,[],"Trypanosoma brucei ornithine decarboxylase was reconstituted by coexpression of two polypeptides corresponding to residues 1-305 and residues 306-425 in Escherichia coli. The two peptides were coexpressed, at wild-type levels, from a single transcriptional unit that was separated by a 15-nucleotide untranslated region containing a ribosome binding site. The fragmented enzyme was purified and analyzed. The N- and C-terminal peptides are tightly associated into a fully active tetramer which has the same molecular weight as the native dimer. The kinetic constants (Km and kcat) measured for the decarboxylation of ornithine are identical to those obtained for the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that the enzyme is organized into two structural domains, with a domain boundary in the region of amino acid 305. In contrast, the individual N- and C-terminal peptides are expressed primarily as inclusion bodies. Small quantities of soluble N-terminal peptide could be purified. This truncated protein is capable of inhibiting the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that it is folded into a native-like structure. Limited proteolysis with trypsin or chymotrypsin identifies a likely surface loop at amino acids 160-170, present in both the mouse and T. brucei enzyme, which positions one or more functionally important active site residues (e.g., Lys169). Kinetic analysis of a chimeric enzyme composed of T. brucei and mouse ornithine decarboxylase suggests that the substrate carboxylate binding determinant is located between residues 1 and 170."
1688,Competition between inhibitors of the trypanosome alternative oxidase (TAO) and reduced coenzyme Q9.,10.1016/0006-2952(95)00259-3,1995-10-12,[],"The trypanosome alternative oxidase (TAO) is an attractive target for chemotherapy for the diseases caused by African trypanosomes because there is no equivalent enzyme in mammalian hosts. Many inhibitors of this enzyme have been described, but there have been no data on the mechanism of inhibition. In the present study, reduced 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (decyl-CoQ-H2) was used as a substitute for the natural substrate CoQ9-H2 to allow direct measurements of the TAO in crude mitochondrial preparations from Trypanosoma brucei brucei. A Km value of 3.8 microM was obtained for this substrate. The following five compounds that have alkyl side chains from 1 to 4 carbons and belong to three classes of inhibitors showed a competitive inhibition pattern with respect to decyl-CoQ-H: p-methoxybenzhydroxamic acid, p-ethoxybenzhydroxamic acid,p-n-butyloxybenzhydroxamic acid, methyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate and N-n-butyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzamide. The following four compounds belonging to the same chemical classes but having alkyl side chains from 10 to 12 carbons showed uncompetitive inhibition patterns: p-n-dodecyloxybenzhydroxamic acid, n-decyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, n-dodecyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, and N-n-decyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzamide. Clearly, the first group of inhibitors compete with CoQ-H2 for the active site of the TAO. We propose that the uncompetitive patterns produced by the second group of inhibitors are due to the greater lipophilicity of these compounds and the resulting change in the interaction of the inhibitors and the membrane containing the TAO, thus affecting the local concentration of the inhibitors at the active site."
1691,Ca2+ storage in Trypanosoma brucei: the influence of cytoplasmic pH and importance of vacuolar acidity.,10.1042/bj3100789,1995-09-15,[],"The hypothesis that changes in cytosolic pH effect the release from intracellular compartments of stored calcium in Trypanosoma brucei was addressed by the use of procyclic and bloodstream trypomastigotes of T. brucei loaded with the fluorescent reagents 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) to measure intracellular pH (pHi), or fura 2 to measure intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i). Experiments were performed in EGTA-containing buffers, so increases in [Ca2+]i reflected release of stored calcium rather than Ca2+ entry. Nigericin reduced pHi and increased [Ca2+]i in loaded cells, whilst propionate reduced pHi, but did not affect [Ca2+]i, and NH4Cl increased both variables, so there appears to be no correlation between pHi and [Ca2+]i. Treatment of the cells with the calcium ionophore ionomycin under similar conditions (nominal absence of extracellular Ca2+) resulted in an increase of [Ca2+]i which was greatly increased by addition of either NH4Cl, nigericin or the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1. Similar results were obtained when the order of additions was reversed or when digitonin-permeabilized cells were used with the Ca2+ indicator arsenazo III. The results suggest that more Ca2+ is stored in this acidic compartment in procyclic than in bloodstream forms. Taking into account the relative importance of the ionomycin-releasable and the ionomycin-plus-NH4Cl-releasable Ca2+ pools, it is apparent that a significant amount of the Ca2+ stored in T. brucei trypomastigotes is present in the acidic compartment thus identified."
1692,The kinetics of maturation of trypanosome infections in tsetse.,10.1017/s0031182000064933,1995-08-01,[],"Estimates of the time delay between the infective bloodmeal and maturation (incubation or maturation time) for 4 trypanosome stocks (2 Trypanozoon and 2 Trypanosoma congolense) show that maturation time in tsetse is not a parasite species-specific constant. The mean incubation time of a Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense stock (EATRO 2340 - 18 days) was not significantly different from one T. congolense stock (SIKUDA88 - 15.5 days) but was significantly greater than another (1/148 FLY9 - 12.5 days). There was no significant difference in incubation times between male and female Glossina morsitans morsitans for any of the stocks but in both of the Trypanozoon stocks the proportion of female flies producing mature infections was significantly less than in males. However, estimates of gene frequency, assuming a model in which maturation is controlled by an X-linked recessive allele, gave inconsistent results indicating that maturation cannot be controlled by a single sex-linked gene. Maturation was shown to be a tsetse sex-dependent phenomenon in Trypanozoon but not in T. congolense infections. Incubation time was quite variable even for a single trypanosome stock (e.g., standard deviation of 5 days for one Trypanozoon stock); we discuss how this variability can affect disease transmission, and the interpretation of age-prevalence data."
1693,Specificity of ethanolamine transport and its further metabolism in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.270.27.16160,1995-07-07,[],"Ethanolamine is found in trypanosomes as an integral component of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) and the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Steps in the utilization of ethanolamine could represent novel targets for the development of chemotherapeutic drugs and were therefore investigated in detail. Transport of [3H]ethanolamine was studied using structural analogs of ethanolamine. Compounds with substitutions in the amino group or of one of the methylene hydrogens of ethanolamine were the most effective inhibitors. Those analogs studied in detail with respect to their kinetic properties were all found to be competitive inhibitors of ethanolamine transport. Following uptake, ethanolamine is rapidly phosphorylated by an ethanolamine-specific kinase to form phosphoethanolamine. Other acid-soluble intermediates identified by thin layer chromatography were CDP-ethanolamine, dCDP-ethanolamine, and glycerophosphorylethanolamine. The relative amounts of these metabolites varied between slender (dividing) and stumpy (non-dividing) trypanosomes and may reflect special biosynthetic needs of the different morphological forms. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the acid-soluble metabolites served as precursors for chloroform/methanol-soluble lipids. Radioactive lipids included PE, mono-methyl and dimethyl PE, and lysoPE. Further methylation of dimethylPE to phosphatidylcholine was not observed under the experimental conditions described. These results are consistent with the conclusion that trypanosomes are able to synthesize phospholipids via the Kennedy pathway."
1695,A diamidine-resistant Trypanosoma equiperdum clone contains a P2 purine transporter with reduced substrate affinity.,10.1016/0166-6851(95)00120-p,1995-07-01,[],"Following the demonstration that the transport of melaminophenyl arsenical drugs in Trypanosoma brucei is dependent upon an unusual adenosine nucleoside transporter (Carter and Fairlamb, Nature 361 (1993) 173-175) we have investigated adenosine transport in the related parasite Trypanosoma equiperdum (Botat1.1) and a cloned derivative resistant to the diamidine drug berenil (diminazene aceturate) with limited cross-resistance to the melaminophenyl arsenical cymelarsen. The parental strain possesses a bipartite adenosine transport system consisting of one component which is inhibited in a dose-dependent and saturable manner with increasing concentrations of inosine and a second component which is similarly inhibited by adenine. Uptake of adenosine on this second transporter is also inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by berenil and cymelarsen. Both transporters have high affinity for adenosine (apparent Km values of 0.60 and 0.70 mM and Vmax values of 8.4 and 6.9 pmol (s (10(8) trypanosomes))-1 at 25 degrees C, respectively). Thus T. equiperdum shares with T. brucei a system comprising two adenosine transporters named P1 and P2, respectively. The P1 transporter is similar in the sensitive and resistant T. equiperdum clones, whereas the P2 transporter has reduced transport capacity at physiological adenosine concentration and decreased affinity for adenosine in the drug-resistant clone."
1696,Trypanosoma brucei dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase: gene isolation and expression and characterization of the enzyme.,10.1016/0166-6851(95)00059-a,1995-06-01,[],"The gene encoding the bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS) of Trypanosoma brucei brucei has been isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the enzyme has been purified and characterized. The coding sequence of the DHFR-TS is 1581 nt, encoding a 527-amino-acid protein of 58,505 Da. The gene was expressed under control of the trc promoter in pKK233-2. The resulting expression plasmid conferred trimethoprim resistance to E. coli DH5 alpha and complemented the TS deficiency in chi 2913recA cells indicating the presence of active DHFR and TS. DHFR-TS was purified by methotrexate-Sepharose chromatography. In addition to the full-length enzyme, the purified enzyme contained 31 and 31.5-kDa forms of the enzyme that cross-reacted with anti-L. major DHFR-TS antibodies; one was truncated at the N- and C termini, and the other at only the C terminus. Despite the presence of sufficient TS for complementation, TS activity was not detectable in the crude extract or in the final purified enzyme preparation. Although the majority of the enzyme appears to be full length, it is possible that the TS domain has been degraded by one of more residues, which would inactivate the ability to synthesize thymidylate. Kinetic analysis of DHFR yielded kcat and Km values similar to those of related enzymes. The T. brucei DHFR has Ki values for antimicrobial antifolates pyrimethamine and trimethoprim which are significantly lower than the closely related T. cruzi or L. major DHFRs or than human DHFR."

These enzymes have been highly purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by phenyl-Sepharose and phospho-ultrogel chromatography. From 1 liter of bacterial culture, we obtained 4.4 mg of T. brucei enzyme, with a specific activity of 147 units/mg, and 26.6 mg of T. cruzi enzyme, with a specific activity of 122 units/mg. Both proteins have a similar subunit mass of 38 kDa. Some physicochemical and kinetic properties have been determined and compared with those reported for the authentic T. brucei enzyme. The two enzymes appear to be very similar, except for the dependence of their activity on ionic strength."
1698,Acidic residues important for substrate binding and cofactor reactivity in eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase identified by alanine scanning mutagenesis.,10.1074/jbc.270.20.11797,1995-05-19,[],"Ornithine decarboxylases from Trypanosoma brucei, mouse, and Leishmania donovani share strict specificity for three basic amino acids, ornithine, lysine, and arginine. To identify residues involved in this substrate specificity and/or in the reaction chemistry, six conserved acidic resides (Asp-88, Glu-94, Asp-233, Glu-274, Asp-361, and Asp-364) were mutated to alanine in the T. brucei enzyme. Each mutation causes a substantial loss in enzyme efficiency. Most notably, mutation of Asp-361 increases the Km for ornithine by 2000-fold, with little effect on kcat, suggesting that this residue is an important substrate binding determinant. Mutation of the only strictly conserved acidic residue, Glu-274, decreases kcat 50-fold; however, substitution of N-methylpyridoxal-5'-phosphate for pyridoxal-5'-phosphate as the cofactor in the reaction restores the kcat of E274A to wild-type levels. These data demonstrate that Glu-274 interacts with the protonated pyridine nitrogen of the cofactor to enhance the electron withdrawing capability of the ring, analogous to Asp-222 in aspartate aminotransferase (Onuffer, J. J., and Kirsch, J. F. (1994) Protein Eng. 7, 413-424). Eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase is a homodimer with two shared active sites. Residues 88, 94, 233, and 274 are contributed to each active site from the same subunit as Lys-69, while residues 361 and 364 are part of the Cys-360 subunit."
1701,Host plasma low density lipoprotein particles as an essential source of lipids for the bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.270.11.5736,1995-03-17,[],"In contrast to mammalian cells, bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei show no activity for fatty acid and sterol synthesis and critically depend on plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles for their rapid growth. We report here that these parasites acquire such lipids by receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL, subsequent lysosomal degradation of apoprotein B-LDL, and utilization of these lipids. Uptake of LDL-associated [3H]sphingomyelin and of LDL-associated [3H]cholesteryl oleate paralleled each other, and that of 125I-apoprotein B-LDL showed saturation and could be inhibited by unlabeled LDL or by anti-LDL receptor antibodies. Metabolism of lipids carried by LDL was abolished by chloroquine and by the thiol protease inhibitor, leupeptin. Sphingomyelin was cleaved by an acid sphingomyelinase to yield ceramide, which was itself split up into sphingosine and fatty acids. The latter were further incorporated into phosphatidylcholine, triacylglycerols, or cholesteryl esters. Similarly, cholesteryl oleate was hydrolyzed by an acid lipase to yield free cholesterol, which was reesterified with fatty acids, presumably in the cytosol. Like free cholesterol, LDL provided substrate for cholesterol esterification. In the culture-adapted procyclic form of T. brucei, which is capable of sterol synthesis, exogenous LDL-cholesterol rather than endogenously synthesized sterol was utilized for sterol esterification. Interference with exogenous supply of lipids via receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL should be explored to fight against trypanosomiasis."
1704,Pharmacokinetics and adverse reactions after a single dose of pentamidine in patients with Trypanosoma gambiense sleeping sickness.,10.1111/j.1365-2125.1995.tb04451.x,1995-03-01,[],"1. Plasma concentrations of pentamidine were measured up to 1-8 months after a single 2 h i.v. infusion of 3.0 to 4.8 mg kg-1 pentamidine isethionate in 11 patients with late stage Trypanosoma gambiense sleeping sickness. 2. Maximum plasma drug concentrations varied between 713 and 2461 nmol 1-1. After termination of infusion, a rapid distribution phase over 10 min was followed by a slower distribution phase and an elimination phase prolonged over weeks to months. 3. The 'terminal' elimination rate constant could be determined in six patients and subsequent kinetic calculations showed a three to fourfold variation in plasma clearance and 'terminal' half-life (median 1126 (range 553-2036) ml min-1 and 265 (107-446) h, respectively). The median apparent volume of distribution (Vss) was 11,850 1. Renal clearance accounted for a median of 11% of total plasma clearance, indicating that metabolism is a major route of pentamidine elimination in man. 4. Side effects were few and mild and a slight or moderate decrease in blood pressure was the most common registered adverse reaction observed in four subjects. 5. The prolonged elimination of pentamidine seems inconsistent with the present recommended dosage regimen of pentamidine for treatment of trypanosomiasis of 7 to 10 parenteral doses given once daily or every second day."
1706,Glycosylphosphatidylinositol toxin of Trypanosoma brucei regulates IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha expression in macrophages by protein tyrosine kinase mediated signal transduction.,10.1006/bbrc.1994.2763,1994-12-15,[],"A purified, structurally defined glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) derived from the Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) of Trypanosoma brucei, and its biosynthetic precursor P2, was able at submicromolar concentrations to regulate cytokine expression when added directly as pharmacological agonist to host macrophages, by activation of an endogenous protein tyrosine-kinase (PTK) mediated signal transduction pathway. GPI induces rapid onset tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple intracellular substrates, within minutes of addition to LPS-nonresponsive cells, followed shortly thereafter by IL-1 alpha secretion. The PTK antagonists genistein and tyrphostin inhibit both tyrosylphosphorylation and cytokine expression. A monoclonal antibody to GPI also blocks IL-1 alpha induction by total parasite extracts. Thus, as in malaria infection, GPI may induce the cytokine excess causing certain pathological states associated with trypanosomiasis."
1707,Formation of functional cross-species heterodimers of ornithine decarboxylase.,10.1021/bi00250a016,1994-11-22,[],"The two active sites in ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) are formed at the dimer interface with Lys-69 and Cys-360 contributing to each active site from opposite monomers [Tobias, K. E., & Kahana, C. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 5842-5847]. To gain insight into the organization of the substrate binding site and the nature of the dimer interface, analysis of ornithine decarboxylase from two parasitic protozoa, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania donovani, and from mouse was undertaken. Though T. brucei and mouse ornithine decarboxylase share only 60% sequence identity, the cross-species heterodimers form spontaneously, as measured by the restoration of enzyme activity upon mixing inactive K69A and C360A mutant enzymes. Thus, the amino acid composition of the dimer interface is apparently highly conserved between the T. brucei and mouse enzymes. Cross-species heterodimers were not formed between either T. brucei or mouse ODC and L. donovani ODC. Unlike the mouse and T. brucei ODC, the subunits of L. donovani ODC are not in rapid equilibrium, and incubation with a denaturant is required to induce reassociation. Kinetic analysis of the wild-type mouse and parasite ODCs revealed differences in the substrate binding sites between the three enzymes. The substrate binding properties of the restored active site in the T. brucei:mouse cross-species heterodimer mimic the characteristics of the wild-type enzyme from the species which contributes the subunit with a functional Lys-69."
1708,Transport of a lysosomal membrane glycoprotein from the Golgi to endosomes and lysosomes via the cell surface in African trypanosomes.,10.1242/jcs.107.11.3191,1994-11-01,[],"gp57/42 is a membrane glycoprotein localized in the trans-Golgi, flagellar pocket region of the cell surface, endosomes and lysosomes of bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Pulse-chase immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that gp57/42 acquires a unique N-linked oligosaccharide recognized by the CB1 monoclonal antibody 20-30 minutes after protein synthesis, probably in the trans-Golgi. We refer to gp57/42 molecules that carry the CB1 epitope as CB1-gp. Pulse labeled CB1-gp contained only one core protein, p57, when chase times were 30 minutes or less. As time of chase increased from 30 to 60 minutes, a new polypeptide, p42, appeared in N-glycanase-treated CB1 immunoprecipitates. Since p57 and p42 share 10 of 13 methionyl peptides, we conclude that p42 is a fragment of p57. Cleavage of p57 to p42 was not inhibited when cells were chased in two thiol protease inhibitors or in 3,4-diisocoumarin, but was inhibited by leupeptin. Cell surface biotinylation was used to determine if newly synthesized CB1-gp was transported from the Golgi to the surface. When cells were pulse labeled and chased for 30 minutes, as much as 40% of the radiolabeled CB1-gp could be biotinylated on the cell surface. The amount of CB1-gp that could be biotinylated decreased when chases were extended from 30 to 60 minutes, suggesting that pulse labeled CB1-gp left the surface. In contrast, pulse labeled variant surface glycoprotein molecules continued to accumulate on the surface where they could be biotinylated between 30 and 60 minutes of chase. Biotinylated CB1-gp derived from cells chased for 30 minutes contained p57 but no p42. However, when labeled cells were biotinylated after a 30 minute chase and then incubated another 30 minutes at 37 degrees C, the biotinylated CB1-gp contained both p57 and p42. The p57 in biotinylated CB1-gp was not cleaved to p42 if the additional incubation was done at 4 or 12 degrees C. This suggests that transport to a compartment where processing occurs and/or the processing enzymes are inhibited by low temperature. When surface biotinylation was done after a 60 minute chase, p42 was detected in biotinylated CB1-gp, suggesting that CB1-gp molecules had passed through the processing compartment and then appeared on the cell surface. Thus, a major portion of the newly synthesized CB1-gp is routed from the Golgi to endocytic compartments via the cell surface. In trypanosomes this process involves a unique surface domain, the flagellar pocket.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
1709,Trypanosoma brucei mitochondria contain RNA helicase activity.,10.1093/nar/22.20.4050,1994-10-11,[],"Mitochondrial gene expression in kinetoplastid organisms such as Trypanosoma, Leishmania and Crithidia requires a posttranscriptional RNA processing event known as kRNA editing. During editing, uridine nucleotides get inserted and deleted into pre-mRNAs directed by small, metabolically stable RNAs, termed guide RNAs. Although the precise mechanism of the reaction is not understood, the accepted working model describes the formation of extended anti-parallel RNA helices between gRNA molecules with pre- and partially edited mRNAs as intermediates. These duplex structures must be separated to ensure the sequential action of multiple gRNAs in a 3' to 5' polarity on the mRNA molecule. In spite of this fact, no unwinding activity has heretofore been identified in kinetoplastid mitochondria. We report the characterisation of a RNA helicase activity within Trypanosoma brucei mitochondrial extracts. The activity unwinds 25- and 48 bp, tailed RNA duplex structures but fails to separate DNA strands. It can be destroyed by heat denaturation as well as by proteinase K treatment. The activity requires magnesium cations and acts in a NTP/dNTP dependent manner. Hydrolysis of a nucleoside triphosphate is required rather than mere NTP binding as deduced from a comparison of unwinding in the presence of ATP and AMP-PCP. RNA duplexes mimicking presumed kRNA editing intermediates are substrates of the unwinding activity and therefore, we address the possible involvement of a RNA helicase activity during kRNA editing."
1710,Purification and characterization of the native and the recombinant Leishmania mexicana glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.00143.x,1994-10-01,[],"The gene coding for the glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leishmania mexicana has been cloned into vector pET3A and expressed as a soluble and active protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) in which the endogenous gene has been inactivated by mutation. The recombinant enzyme was purified to near homogeneity by ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by hydrophobic and cation-exchange chromatography. From a 1-L culture of E. coli cells, 25 mg purified protein was obtained with a specific activity of 125 units/mg. The recombinant protein restores the natural E. coli phenotype when expressed at low level. The enzyme has also been partially purified from glycosomes of cultured L. mexicana promastigotes. The recombinant and the native proteins show identical mobilities on SDS/PAGE, and have the same isoelectric point and similar pH-activity profiles. The kinetics of both enzymes are very similar, the most important aspect being their lower apparent affinity for the cofactor NAD when compared to all other homologous enzymes studied, with the exception of glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma brucei."
1715,A novel heterodimeric transferrin receptor encoded by a pair of VSG expression site-associated genes in T. brucei.,10.1016/0092-8674(94)90574-6,1994-07-15,[],"In T. brucei, a transferrin-binding protein has been found to share sequence homology with pESAG-7 and -6, the products of two related genes present in the VSG gene polycistronic transcription unit. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, they appear as N-glycosylated proteins secreted in the medium (pESAG-7) and GPI anchored to the membrane (pESAG-6). These proteins are able to homo- or heterodimerize, probably through association in the same orientation. Only heterodimers can bind Tf, possibly two molecules per dimer. A comparison of Tf binding to pESAG-7/6-expressing oocytes and trypanosomes suggests that pESAG-7/6 is the Tf receptor of the parasite. In trypanosomes, the majority of pESAG-7/6 is released from the membrane and associates, together with Tf, with a glycosylated matrix present in the lumen of the flagellar pocket. Both pESAG-7/6 and Tf are internalized via coated pits and vesicles. These observations suggest a novel mode of Tf binding and uptake in trypanosomes."
1717,Mitochondrial minicircle DNA supports plasmid replication and maintenance in nuclei of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1073/pnas.91.13.5962,1994-06-21,[],"In a search for trypanosome DNA sequences that permit replication and stable maintenance of extrachromosomal elements, a 1-kilobase-pair (kbp) fragment from a mitochondrial kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) minicircle of Trypanosoma brucei was isolated and characterized. The plasmid pTbo-1, carrying the kDNA element, is maintained in T. brucei as a supercoiled concatemer containing approximately seven to nine pTbo-1 monomer units (5.6 kbp each) in a head-to-tail orientation. The concatemer is found in approximately one copy per cell when procyclic trypanosomes are cultured in the presence of 100 micrograms of hygromycin per ml; however, in the absence of continuous hygromycin selection, the plasmid is lost from the population with a t1/2 of approximately 8.7 days (17 cell generations). A second unrelated kDNA minicircle was also able to serve as an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) element in T. brucei, suggesting that this is a general property of kDNA minicircles. Replication of mitochondrial DNA in the nucleus may be due to either a specific consensus sequence (such as in yeast ARS elements) or nonspecific sequence characteristics (such as the degree of A&T-richness or bent DNA)."
1720,"Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase in the trypanosoma subgenus, trypanozoon.",10.1016/0166-6851(93)00016-3,1994-04-01,[],"The enzyme dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase has been discovered and characterised in four salivarian trypanosomes of the subgenus trypanozoon: Trypanosoma brucei brucei, T. b. gambiense, T. b. rhodesiense, and Trypanosoma evansi. The three T. brucei species, which have insect procyclic forms biochemically distinct from their mammalian bloodstream forms, express dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase in both cell types, but have higher levels in the procyclic forms. Determination of Michaelis constants for the enzyme from each of the three T. brucei species did not reveal any significant kinetic differences between the bloodstream and procyclic enzymes. On Western blots, antibodies raised against dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from the stereorarian trypanosome, Trypanosoma cruzi, cross-react strongly with the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from all three T. brucei species; by this method, the relative molecular masses of their dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenases are indistinguishable. Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase was purified from both the bloodstream and the procyclic forms of T. b. brucei, and the N-terminal have been sequenced. These sequences are identical to the derived protein sequence of the cloned gene (Else et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 212 (1993) 423-429), but have a nine amino acid N-terminal truncation, giving an N-terminus equivalent to that of T. cruzi dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. The T. b. brucei dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase gene has been expressed in Escherichia coli and the resultant protein purified; its N-terminus is processed in a similar fashion to that in the trypanosome, but with reduced specificity."
1721,The formation of mitochondrial ribonucleoprotein complexes involving guide RNA molecules in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1073/pnas.91.5.1776,1994-03-01,[],"Transcripts from mitochondrial (maxicircle) genes of kinetoplastid organisms undergo RNA editing characterized by a series of reactions that insert and delete uridine nucleotides within the sequence of the pre-mRNAs. Guide RNAs, which complement fully edited mRNAs, provide the information for the edited sequence by an unknown mechanism. We report here that guide RNA molecules associate with other mitochondrial components to form four specific, stable ribonucleoprotein complexes. The complexes form very rapidly at a low monovalent cation concentration, and their formation is blocked by heparin or pretreatment of the mitochondrial lysate with SDS. ATP hydrolysis is not required but slightly stimulates complex association up to concentrations of 5 mM. The results are suggestive of a sequential assembly of the ribonucleoprotein complexes, and their possible involvement during the kinetoplastid RNA editing is discussed."
1724,Inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by phosphorylated epoxides and alpha-enones.,10.1021/bi00167a028,1994-01-11,[],"Pentalenolactone and koningic acid are antibiotics known for their potent inhibition of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The reactive groups present in these antibiotics are, respectively, an epoxide and an alpha-enone, which form covalent bonds with an active-site cysteine residue of the enzyme. This information was used for the design of two series of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate analogues with similar reactive groups that could function as potential irreversible inhibitors of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Inactivation kinetics, NMR analysis, protection experiments, and titration of free cysteine residues together indicate that the inhibitors bind to the active site of the enzyme and form a covalent bond with the active-site cysteine residue of the enzyme. Binding probably takes place at the inorganic phosphate site of the enzyme and may lead to a conformational change. Comparison of the reactivities of the inhibitors for the glycosomal enzyme from the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei and the rabbit muscle enzyme revealed that some of them had a preference for the trypanosome enzyme. When their effect was measured on the multiplication of trypanosome in vitro cultures, one inhibitor appeared to exhibit an inhibitory effect at a concentration significantly lower than the trypanocidal drugs, pentamidin and (difluoromethyl)ornithine, that are routinely used in the treatment of African sleeping sickness."
1727,Identification and characterization of an acidic major surface glycoprotein from procyclic stage Trypanosoma congolense.,10.1016/0166-6851(93)90074-8,1993-10-01,[],"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were derived against the procyclic culture form of Trypanosoma congolense and 14 were selected which bound to the surface of living procyclics in immunofluorescence assays. These antibodies bound to procyclics and epimastigotes of T. congolense (both savannah-type and Kilifi-type) and procyclics of Trypanosoma simiae, but not to procyclics of other species of trypanosomes, to bloodstream forms of several species of trypanosomes or to Leishmania, and were thus life cycle stage- and subgenus-specific. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with these antibodies showed that the kinetics of expression of the surface antigen during transformation from bloodstream to procyclic forms was similar to that of procyclin or procyclic acidic repetitive protein (PARP) of T. brucei spp. appearing at the cell surface as early as 8 h after initiating transformation. All fourteen antibodies detected broad bands of 40-44 and 28-32 kDa in immunoblot analysis of whole procyclic lysates and were specific for carbohydrate epitopes. The antigen was purified by cation-exchange chromatography and gel electrophoresis, and was shown to be an acidic glycoprotein. Amino acid microanalysis of the purified antigen showed an abundance of glutamic acid/glutamine and alanine. Sequences of peptides produced by cyanogen bromide cleavage matched amino acid sequences predicted by the nucleotide sequence of a gene described in the accompanying paper by Bayne et al. [26]. No sequence similarity to T. brucei procyclin/PARP or to any other protein was found. However, its stage and subgenus specificity, surface disposition, immunodominance, acidity and kinetics of expression during transformation from bloodstream to procyclic forms indicate that the molecule is an analog of procyclin/PARP described in T. brucei spp."
1729,Transient adenylate cyclase activation accompanies differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei from bloodstream to procyclic forms.,10.1016/0166-6851(93)90164-s,1993-09-01,[],"Pleomorphic bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei differentiate synchronously into procyclic forms when cultivated at 27 degrees C in the presence of citrate/cis-aconitate. The activity of adenylate cyclase was monitored during this process. Two phases of transient stimulation were observed. The first phase occurred 6-10 h after the triggering of differentiation, a period which immediately follows the release of the bulk of the VSG and immediately precedes both the first cell division and the loss of the bloodstream-specific ESAG 4 transmembrane adenylate cyclase. The second phase occurred between 20 and 40 h, when the cells that emerged from the first division began to proliferate. These observations suggest that cAMP may be involved in differentiation/proliferation of the parasite."
1730,Abrupt RNA changes precede the first cell division during the differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms into procyclic forms in vitro.,10.1016/0166-6851(93)90163-r,1993-09-01,[],"We have monitored the timing of DNA and RNA synthesis during the synchronous differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms into procyclic forms in vitro. Both are triggered after a lag period of 4 h and reach a first peak after 9 h. The division of the kinetoplast precedes that of the nucleus by about 4 h. The first cell divisions are observed after 10 h, and the cell number is doubled after 20 h. The total RNA content per cell increases sharply between 4 and 10 h, then progressively decreases as cell division progresses. The increase in RNA content cannot be due solely to accumulation of rRNA since it is also observed for mRNAs such as actin. The VSG mRNA has almost disappeared within 2 h, while the procyclin mRNA accumulates soon after the triggering of differentiation, with a strong peak between 4 and 6 h. At this moment, the amount of procyclin mRNA per cell is at least 20-fold higher than in established procyclic culture forms. The loss of the VSG and the appearance of procyclic-specific proteins essentially occur before the first cell division. These observations contrast with the progressive transition observed when monomorphic slender forms are induced to transform under the same conditions."
1738,Proteolytic release of cell surface proteins during differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1021/bi00065a028,1993-04-13,[],"The surface of the bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei is covered by the abundant glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored variant surface protein (mfVSG). During differentiation of bloodstream forms to the insect-stage or procyclic forms, the mfVSG is replaced by another glycoprotein, designated procyclic acidic repetitive protein (PARP) or procyclin. Shortly after differentiation is triggered in vitro, a cell-associated fragment of mfVSG can be detected which is subsequently released into the culture medium. In the case of the mfVSG of the variant clone MITat 1.4 (470 amino acid residues), fragmentation occurs close to the COOH-terminus (Gln433 or Thr434) as shown by NH2-terminal sequencing, metabolic labeling experiments, and molecular weight determinations by laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Two invariant surface glycoproteins, which are anchored in the membrane by hydrophobic sequences close to their COOH-termini, are lost from the surface with similar kinetics as mfVSG. The data suggest that trypanosomes synthesize or activate a developmentally-regulated proteinase which degrades the glycoproteins at the surface, at the membrane lining the flagellar pocket, and/or in an early endocytic compartment."
1739,Active transport of L-proline in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1042/bj2910297,1993-04-01,[],"The characteristics of L-proline transport in the procyclic form of Trypanosoma brucei were studied by using L-[14C]proline and a quick separation technique by centrifugation through an oil mixture. L-Proline uptake displayed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a Km of 19 microM and a maximum transport velocity of 17 nmol/min per 10(8) cells at 27 degrees C. The maximum concentration gradient factor obtained after 1 min of incubation was 270-fold in 0.02 mM proline. Cells permeabilized with 80 microM digitonin were still able to accumulate 14C label, but to a lower extent. The temperature-dependence of proline uptake gave an apparent activation energy of 74.9 kJ.mol-1. In competition studies with a 10-fold excess of structural analogues, L-alanine, L-cysteine and L-azetidine-2-carboxylate were found to inhibit L-proline uptake. Variation of pH or addition of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone ('CCCP') did not affect proline transport, showing that it is not driven by a protonmotive force. The absence of Na+, with or without monensin, did not affect proline transport. The absence of K+ and the addition of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase inhibitor ouabain had no significant effect on proline uptake activity. The thiol-modifying reagent iodoacetate (10 mM) decreased proline uptake by half. KCN (1 mM) inhibited proline uptake to a lesser extent, and the degree of inhibition was proportional to the intracellular ATP concentration. Preliminary experiments on proline transport in plasma-membrane vesicles of the cells, using a filtration technique, showed an uptake of proline (0.67 nmol/mg of protein) by the vesicles, but only in the presence of intravesicular ATP. The results thus obtained suggest that the proline carrier system in T. brucei is ATP-driven and independent of Na+, K+ or H+ co-transport."
1740,Protein kinases in divergent eukaryotes: identification of protein kinase activities regulated during trypanosome development.,10.1073/pnas.90.7.2656,1993-04-01,[],"The role of protein kinases in organisms that diverged early in the eukaryotic lineage is relatively unexplored. In this study, we determined that primitive parasitic protozoa possess multiple protein-serine kinases and inferred the presence of protein-tyrosine kinases through sensitive immunoblotting techniques. To further explore the role of protein kinases in parasite development, we examined the activity of eight renaturable protein kinases during the life cycle of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. The activities of six protein-serine/threonine kinases were regulated during development, with several distinct patterns of regulation. In addition, an 89-kDa protein kinase was detected in dividing cells but not in nondividing cells. Our data indicate that even the most primitive eukaryotes possess a large complement of protein kinases, including protein-tyrosine kinases as well as protein-serine/threonine kinases. The data further suggest that protein kinases may play a pivotal role in regulation of proliferation and differentiation in protozoa."
1741,S-adenosylmethionine synthetase in bloodstream Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0925-4439(93)90092-f,1993-03-24,[],"S-adenosylmethionine synthetase was studied from bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, the agent of African sleeping sickness. Two isoforms of the enzyme were evident from Eadie Hofstee and Hanes-Woolf plots of varying ATP or methionine concentrations. In the range 10-250 microM the Km for methionine was 20 microM, and this changed to 200 microM for the range 0.5-5.0 mM. In the range 10-250 microM the Km for ATP was 53 microM, and this changed to 1.75 mM for the range 0.5-5.0 mM. The trypanosome enzyme had a molecular weight of 145 kDa determined by agarose gel filtration. Methionine analogs including selenomethionine, L-2-amino-4-methoxy-cis but-3-enoic acid and ethionine acted as competitive inhibitors of methionine and as weak substrates when tested in the absence of methionine with [14C]ATP. The enzyme was not inducible in procyclic trypomastigotes in vitro, and the enzyme half-life was > 6 h. T. b. brucei AdoMet synthetase was inhibited by AdoMet (Ki 240 microM). The relative insensitivity of the trypanosome enzyme to control by product inhibition indicates it is markedly different from mammalian isoforms of the enzyme which are highly sensitive to AdoMet. Since trypanosomes treated with the ornithine decarboxylase antagonist DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine accumulate AdoMet and dcAdoMet (final concentration approximately 5 mM), this enzyme may be the critical drug target linking inhibition of polyamine synthesis to disruption of AdoMet metabolism."
1744,Arsenical-resistant trypanosomes lack an unusual adenosine transporter.,10.1038/361173a0,1993-01-14,[],"The melaminophenyl arsenical melarsoprol is still used to treat African sleeping sickness, a disease caused by parasitic protozoa of the Trypanosoma brucei subgroup. Based on the observation that melamine antagonizes the trypanocidal activity of this class of drugs, we investigated whether other physiological compounds could compete for the same receptor. Here we report that the in vitro trypanolytic effect of melarsen oxide can be specifically abrogated by adenine, adenosine and dipyridamole, all of which compete for uptake by an adenosine transporter. Melarsen-sensitive trypanosomes have two high-affinity adenosine transport systems: a P1 type, which also transports inosine; and a P2 type, which also transports adenine and the melaminophenyl arsenicals. Melarsen-resistant trypanosomes lack P2 adenosine transport, suggesting that resistance to these arsenicals is due to loss of uptake."
1745,Temporal order of RNA-processing reactions in trypanosomes: rapid trans splicing precedes polyadenylation of newly synthesized tubulin transcripts.,10.1128/mcb.13.1.720-725.1993,1993-01-01,[],"Many trypanosome genes are expressed as part of large polycistronic transcription units. This finding suggests that regulation of mRNA biogenesis may emphasize RNA-processing reactions more so than in other organisms. This study was undertaken to understand the temporal order of two RNA-processing reactions, trans splicing and polyadenylation, in the maturation of trypanosome mRNAs in vivo. Kinetic studies revealed rapid trans splicing of alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin, and actin pre-mRNAs within 1 to 2 min after synthesis of the 3' splice site. Furthermore, following blockage of pre-mRNA synthesis, newly synthesized spliced leader RNA cannot be used for trans splicing, suggesting that trypanosomes do not accumulate substantial amounts of pre-mRNA which can provide splice acceptor sites. Thus, trans splicing is cotranscriptional. In addition, we show that trans splicing precedes polyadenylation in the processing of trypanosome tubulin pre-mRNAs."
1747,Glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C of Trypanosoma brucei: expression in Escherichia coli.,10.1016/0166-6851(92)90180-r,1992-12-01,[],"Glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) from Trypanosoma brucei cleaves the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor of the trypanosome variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) and other GPI structures. We have expressed this enzyme in Escherichia coli, using a protocol designed to produce the native enzyme rather than a fusion protein. We have purified large amounts of GPI-PLC from E. coli membranes, using a single step immunoaffinity technique. The expressed enzyme is identical to its trypanosome counterpart in enzymatic specificity, mobility on SDS-PAGE, and isoelectric point. Recombinant GPI-PLC is a membrane enzyme; it associates with E. coli membranes and, like the T. brucei GPI-PLC, partitions into the detergent phase in Triton X-114 phase separation experiments. The Michaelis constants for the two enzymes are similar (400 nM, with VSG as substrate). The turnover number (kcat, 72 min-1) of the recombinant enzyme (expressed from a. T. brucei rhodesiense WRATat 1.1 cDNA) is about one-tenth that of GPI-PLC from T. brucei brucei (ILTat 1.3)."
1749,Trypanosoma brucei spliced-leader RNA methylations are required for trans splicing in vivo.,10.1128/mcb.12.11.4844-4851.1992,1992-11-01,[],"The Trypanosoma brucei spliced leader (SL) RNA donates its 5' leader sequence to all nuclear pre-mRNAs via trans RNA splicing. The SL RNA is a small-nuclear U RNA-like molecule which is present in the cell as part of a small ribonucleoprotein particle. However, unlike the trimethylguanosine-capped small nuclear U RNAs, the SL RNA has a highly modified 5' terminus containing an m7G cap and methylations on the first four transcribed nucleotides. Here, we show that incubation of procyclic-form T. brucei in the presence of the S-adenosylmethionine analog, sinefungin, leads to a rapid inhibition of SL RNA methylation. A concomitant inhibition of trans splicing and an accumulation of high-molecular-weight tubulin transcripts were also observed. The effects of sinefungin on SL RNA methylation and on trans splicing were correlated by labeling of cells incubated in the presence of the antibiotic. The results indicate that 5' modifications of the SL RNA are necessary for it to participate in trans splicing. SL RNA modification is not required for assembly of the core SL ribonucleoprotein, as these Cs2SO4-resistant particles can be formed with either methylated or undermethylated SL RNA."
1750,Inhibition of IgM antibody-mediated aggregation of Trypanosoma gambiense in the presence of complement.,10.1007/BF01919153,1992-10-15,[],"This paper deals with the immune reaction between Trypanosoma gambiense and monoclonal IgM mouse antibody at equivalence with or without rabbit complement. Antibody-mediated trypanosome clumps formed in the absence of complement, and were readily dissociated by complement to become free. In the presence of complement, on the other hand, T. gambiense were not aggregated by the antibody. Free parasites adhered readily to cultured peritoneal macrophages. Complement-mediated dissociation of the clumped trypanosomes in the equivalence area released a large number of previously bound surface antigens. These antigens were capable of binding again to fresh IgM antibody. Experimental results further indicated that the complement system caused a functional alteration, changing the multivalent nature of the IgM antibody in the immune complex into a univalent one. This phenomenon is of great advantage to the infected host in clearing pathogens in vivo, as it allows more antibodies to attach to trypanosomes and subsequently initiate complement activity."
1752,The mitochondrion in bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei is energized by the electrogenic pumping of protons catalysed by the F1F0-ATPase.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb17278.x,1992-10-01,[],"Bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei were found to maintain a significant membrane potential across their mitochondrial inner membrane (delta psi m) in addition to a plasma membrane potential (delta psi p). Significantly, the delta psi m was selectively abolished by low concentrations of specific inhibitors of the F1F0-ATPase, such as oligomycin, whereas inhibition of mitochondrial respiration with salicylhydroxamic acid was without effect. Thus, the mitochondrial membrane potential is generated and maintained exclusively by the electrogenic translocation of H+, catalysed by the mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase at the expense of ATP rather than by the mitochondrial electron-transport chain present in T. brucei. Consequently, bloodstream forms of T. brucei cannot engage in oxidative phosphorylation. The mitochondrial membrane potential generated by the mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase in intact trypanosomes was calculated after solving the two-compartment problem for the uptake of the lipophilic cation, methyltriphenylphosphonium (MePh3P+) and was shown to have a value of approximately 150 mV. When the value for the delta psi m is combined with that for the mitochondrial pH gradient (Nolan and Voorheis, 1990), the mitochondrial proton-motive force was calculated to be greater than 190 mV. It seems likely that this mitochondrial proton-motive force serves a role in the directional transport of ions and metabolites across the promitochondrial inner membrane during the bloodstream stage of the life cycle, as well as promoting the import of nuclear-encoded protein into the promitochondrion during the transformation of bloodstream forms into the next stage of the life cycle of T. brucei."
1753,Inhibition of the GlcNAc transferase of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis in African trypanosomes.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb17188.x,1992-09-01,[],"A wide variety of eukaryotic membrane proteins are anchored to the cell surface by a covalent linkage to glycosylphosphatidylinositol. One of the best characterised examples is the variant surface glycoprotein of the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei. The pathway for the formation of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol precursor has been previously described, with the first step being the transfer of GlcNAc, from UDP-GlcNAc to endogenous phosphatidylinositol to form N-acetyl-glucosaminylphosphatidylinositol [Doering, T. L., Masterson, W. J., Hart, G. W. & Englund, P. T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11,168-11,173]. Here we report that low concentrations of sulphydryl alkylating reagents irreversibly inhibit this transferase in a trypanosome-derived cell-free system. The site of inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide appears to be at, or close to, the enzyme active site, since incubation of the enzyme preparation with the donor molecule UDP-GlcNAc substantially protects the enzyme from inactivation. The protection appears to be primarily dependent on the nucleotide portion of the molecule, since UMP and UDP can mimic the protection seen with UDP-GlcNAc."
1755,Regulated degradation of ornithine decarboxylase requires interaction with the polyamine-inducible protein antizyme.,10.1128/mcb.12.8.3556-3562.1992,1992-08-01,[],"Intracellular degradation of vertebrate ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is accelerated by polyamines, the products of the pathway controlled by ODC. Antizyme, a reversible, tightly binding protein inhibitor of ODC activity, is believed to be involved in this process. Mouse and Trypanosoma brucei ODCs are structurally similar, but the trypanosome enzyme, unlike that of the mouse, is not regulated by intracellular polyamines when expressed in hamster cells (L. Ghoda, D. Sidney, M. Macrae, and P. Coffino, Mol. Cell. Biol. 12:2178-2185, 1992). We found that mouse ODC interacts with antizyme in vitro but trypanosome ODC does not. To localize the region necessary for binding, we made a series of enzymatically active chimeric mouse-trypanosome ODCs and tested them for antizyme interaction. Replacing residues 117 to 140 within the 461-amino-acid mouse ODC sequence with the equivalent region of trypanosome ODC disrupted both antizyme binding and in vivo regulation. Formation of an antizyme-ODC complex is therefore required for regulated degradation."
1757,The interaction of arsenical drugs with dihydrolipoamide and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from arsenical resistant and sensitive strains of Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(92)90024-e,1992-07-01,[],"D,L-dihydrolipoamide and D,L-dihydrolipoic acid react to form stable complexes with melarsen oxide with association constants of 5.47 x 10(9) and 4.51 x 10(9) M-1, respectively. These complexes possess 6-membered cyclic dithioarsenite rings which are 10-fold less stable than the 5-membered rings found in the trypanocidal drugs melarsoprol and trimelarsen, but 500-fold more stable than the 25-membered macrocyclic ring formed between melarsen oxide and dihydrotrypanothione. L-Lipoic acid concentrations in arsenical sensitive and resistant cloned lines of Trypanosoma brucei brucei have been determined by bioassay using a mutant of Escherichia coli auxotrophic for lipoate. The arsenical resistant strain was found to contain significantly less lipoic acid than the sensitive strain (19.2 +/- 4.3 and 9.7 +/- 2.9 pmol (10(8) cells)-1, respectively). The activity of the plasma membrane-associated dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase was found to be slightly, but significantly increased in the arsenical resistant strain (34.7 +/- 1.4 and 47.8 +/- 3.7 mU mg-1, respectively). However, the Km for dihydrolipoamide and the inactivation kinetics with melarsen oxide were not significantly different between these strains. Estimates of the ratio of substrate to enzyme are of the order of 12:1 and 6:1 for arsenical sensitive and resistant strains, respectively, suggesting that these components are likely to be intimately associated with each other in the plasma membrane. These findings implicate lipoic acid, but not dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, in resistance to arsenical drugs, either through the mechanism of uptake or as the final target of these drugs."
1759,Uptake of the antitrypanosomal drug 5'-([(Z)-4-amino-2-butenyl]methylamino)-5'-deoxyadenosine (MDL 73811) by the purine transport system of Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1042/bj2830755,1992-05-01,[],"An irreversible inhibitor of S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), 5'-([(Z)-4-amino-2-butenyl]methylamino)-5'-deoxyadenosine (MDL 73811), was found to cure Trypanosoma brucei brucei and multidrug-resistant T. b. rhodesiense infections in mice [Bitonti, Byers, Bush, Casara, Bacchi, Clarkson, McCann & Sjoerdsma (1990) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 34, 1485-1490]. Doses of this drug which resulted in a rapid clearance of parasites from T. b. brucei-infected rats resulted in plasma levels of 50-60 microM-MDL 73811 and an intratrypanosomal MDL 73811 concentration of 1.9 mM within 10 min of administration [Byers, Bush, McCann & Bitonti (1991) Biochem. J. 274, 527-533[. Based on this finding we speculated that MDL 73811, which is an adenosine analogue, is a substrate for the trypanosome active purine transport system. We now report evidence that supports this hypothesis. MDL 73811 uptake by T. b. brucei in vitro was time- and temperature-dependent and was saturable over a time course in which MDL 73811 metabolism was undetectable, suggesting that MDL 73811 uptake is a transport-mediated phenomenon. Inhibition of MDL 73811 uptake by purine nucleosides is consistent with the drug being a substrate for the trypanosome purine transport system. The accumulation of MDL 73811 by cultured L1210 mouse leukaemia cells was significantly less than by trypanosomes exposed to the same pharmacologically relevant concentrations of MDL 73811. Given that the half-life of MDL 73811 in the plasma of rats and mice is approx. 10 min, it seems likely that the existence of a highly active parasite transport system for MDL 73811 is crucial for the sensitivity of trypanosomes towards MDL 73811 in vivo, and that the absence of active transport of MDL 73811 by the host's cells may play a role in the selectivity of this drug."
1760,Structural elements of ornithine decarboxylase required for intracellular degradation and polyamine-dependent regulation.,10.1128/mcb.12.5.2178-2185.1992,1992-05-01,[],"Mammalian ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, is rapidly degraded in cells, an attribute important to the regulation of its activity. Mutant and chimeric ODCs were created to determine the structural requirements for two modes of proteolysis. Constitutive degradation requires the carboxy terminus and is independent of intracellular polyamines. Truncation of five or more carboxy-terminal amino acids prevents this mode of degradation, as do several internal deletions within the 37 carboxy-most amino acids that spare the last five residues. Polyamine-dependent degradation of ODC requires a distinct region outside the carboxy terminus. The ODC of a parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, is structurally very similar to mouse ODC but lacks the carboxy-terminal domain; it is not a substrate for either pathway. The regulatory properties of enzymatically active chimeric proteins incorporating regions of the two ODCs support the conclusion that distinct domains of mouse ODC confer constitutive degradation and polyamine-mediated regulation. Mouse ODC contains two PEST regions. The first was not required for either form of degradation; major deletions within the second ablated constitutive degradation. When mouse and T. brucei ODC RNAs were translated in vitro in a reticulocyte lysate system, the effects of polyamine concentration on ODC protein production and activity were similar for the two mRNAs, which contradicts claims that this system accurately reflects the in vivo effects of polyamines on responsive ODCs."
1764,Identification of two distinct galactosyltransferase activities acting on the variant surface glycoprotein of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1042/bj2830479,1992-04-15,[],"Variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) of Trypanosoma brucei contain two distinct glycosylation sites: (1) N-linked glycans within the protein portion of the molecules, and (2) the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchor. Since galactose residues show uncommon alpha-glycosidic linkages in the GPI membrane anchor, we were prompted to investigate galactosylation of the GPI anchor. On comparing a trypanosome clone galactosylated exclusively in N-glycans (clone MITat 1.5) with clones galactosylated predominantly in the glypiated membrane anchor (clones MITat 1.4, MITat 1.6 and AnTat 1.8), clone MITat 1.5 showed a 10-fold increased enzyme activity when using a protocol including Triton X-100 to assay UDPgalactose:N-acetylglucosaminyl glycopeptide beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.38). Only the VSG of clone MITat 1.5 could be radiochemically labelled with UDP[14C]galactose, and galactosylation of N-glycans was confirmed by digestion with peptide-N4-(N-acetylglucosaminyl)asparagine amidase (PNGase F). However, in a modified enzyme assay without detergent, galactosyltransferase activity was increased considerably (15-fold) in clone MITat 1.4. VSG galactosylation of clones MITat 1.4, MITat 1.6 and AnTat 1.8 was readily detected by fluorography of the respective SDS/polyacrylamide gels, suggesting that galactosyltransferase activity modifies the VSG membrane anchor in these clones. In this case, [14C]galactose labelling of immunoprecipitated VSG (clone MITat 1.4) was resistant to the release of N-glycans by PNGase F treatment, and thus revealed galactosylation in vitro of a VSG membrane anchor. Exoglycosidase digestions of VSG MITat 1.4 confirmed the presence of alpha-linked galactose residues. We suggest that these specific alpha-galactosyltransferases are inhibited by the action of detergent, but can be activated in a detergent-free buffer system."
1767,Characterization of different proteolytic activities in Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1016/0925-4439(92)90040-t,1992-03-20,[],"The variant surface glycoprotein of African trypanosomes is released after overnight incubation of parasites at 4 degrees C in pH 5.5 phosphate glucose buffer and may be purified by Concanavalin A Sepharose affinity chromatography. The addition of proteinase inhibitors during the parasite incubation is necessary to prevent the proteolysis of the variant surface glycoprotein by the trypanosomal released proteinases. Using this procedure without the addition of proteinase inhibitors, the proteolytic activities, released from the bloodstream forms Trypanosoma brucei brucei variant AnTat 1.1, were separated by Concanavalin-A Sepharose affinity chromatography. The unretained material (F1) shows hydrolytic activity against the two synthetic substrates Z-Phe-Arg-AMC and Z-Arg-Arg-AMC, which is stimulated by dithiothreitol, but not inhibited by E-64, and characterized by an alkaline pH optimum and an estimated molecular mass of 80-100 kDa. The Michaelis constant for the substrates Z-Arg-Arg-AMC and Z-Phe-Arg-AMC was, respectively, 2.8 and 6.7 microM. The retained material eluted by addition of 1% methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside (F2) shows hydrolytic activity against the synthetic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC, which is stimulated by dithiothreitol, inhibited by E-64, active between pH 6.0 and 8.0, and could be separated into two peaks of activity by HPLC, one peak of high molecular mass (greater than 70 kDa) and the other peak of lower molecular mass (30-70 kDa). By electrophoresis in gels containing gelatin as substrate, this fraction contains several proteins with gelatinolytic activity, whereas the unretained fraction F1 did not have any gelatinolytic activity."
1769,Characterization of an endopeptidase of Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1016/0003-9861(92)90360-9,1992-02-14,[],"A soluble 80-kDa endopeptidase has been isolated from Trypanosoma brucei brucei. The enzyme, which has a pI 5.1, is optimally active at about pH 8.2 and has apparent pKa values of 6.0 and greater than or equal to 10. It is inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate and by the serine protease mechanism-based inhibitor 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin. Unexpectedly, the enzyme is inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Lys-CHN2 but not by the related diazomethane, butoxycarbonyl-Val-Leu-Gly-Lys-CHN2, nor by other cysteine protease specific compounds. Specificity studies with a variety of amidomethylcoumaryl (AMC) derivatives of small peptides show that the enzyme has a highly restricted trypsin-like specificity. The best substrate, based on the magnitude of kcat/Km, was benzyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Arg-AMC; other good substrates were benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-AMC, benzoyl-Arg-AMC, and compounds with Arg at P1 and Ala or Gly at P2. The hydrolysis of most substrates obeyed classical Michaelis-Menton kinetics but several exhibited pronounced substrate inhibition. The enzyme did not activate plasminogen nor decrease blood clotting time; it was inhibited by aprotinin but not by chicken ovomucoid. We conclude that the enzyme is a trypsin-like serine endopeptidase with unusually restricted subsite specificities."
1771,"Characteristics of the binding of human and bovine high-density lipoproteins by bloodstream forms of the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei brucei.",10.1016/0005-2760(92)90002-d,1992-02-12,[],"Bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei are unable to synthesize cholesterol but appear to bind and take up plasma low-density lipoproteins (LDL) from their host. Whether cholesterol homeostasis of this unicellular parasite also requires interactions with host high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles is unknown. Equilibrium binding of radioiodinated apolipoprotein E-depleted human HDL3 (d = 1.125-1.21 g/ml) and bovine HDL (d = 1.063-1.21 g/ml) by T.b.brucei was rapid (less than 30 min) at 4 degrees C and was characterized by a saturable, specific component. There were five times the number of high-affinity binding sites for human HDL3 as for bovine HDL (64,000 vs. 11,500 per trypanosome) and their binding affinity was greater with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 157 nM compared to 315 nM for bovine HDL). Binding of rat and rabbit HDL3 was similar to bovine HDL. By contrast, equilibrium binding of human LDL was slower (approximately 6 h) and the number of high-affinity binding sites (Kd = 23 nM) was much lower for this ligand (660 per trypanosome). Total binding of HDL3 was independent of divalent cations and was only slightly inhibited by heparin, but when the trypanosomes were preincubated with trypsin or pronase the binding was markedly reduced. After 30 min at 37 degrees C, binding of bovine HDL and human HDL3 was 10-20% higher than at 4 degrees C; after 45 min trypanolysis occurred with human HDL3 but not with bovine HDL. Chemical modification of HDL3 by treatment with cyclohexanedione, by acetylation or by reductive alkylation had little effect on its ability to compete with [125I]labelled HDL3 for binding by the parasite. Nitrosylation of HDL3 with tetranitromethane increased its binding ability, suggesting that trypanosomes might possess scavenger receptors, and native HDL3 was less effective than nitrosylated HDL3 in displacing bound [125I]labelled nitrosylated HDL3. These findings suggest that, in addition to a receptor for LDL, T.b.brucei has other lipoprotein binding sites which separately recognize HDL from permissive host species such as bovine, trypanolytic HDL such as human HDL3, and more negatively charged HDL particles such as nitrosylated HDL3."
1776,The actin gene promoter of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1093/nar/19.21.5857,1991-11-11,[],"The actin genes of Trypanosoma brucei are transcribed constitutively during the parasite life-cycle, by a polymerase sensitive to alpha-amanitin. The start region of the actin gene transcription unit was mapped by virtue of the accumulation of promoter-proximal transcripts which occurs following moderate UV irradiation. This region, located about 4 kilobases upstream from the genes, was able to direct transient expression of the bacterial Chloramphenicol Acetyl Transferase (CAT) gene in both bloodstream and procyclic forms of the parasite. The essential region of the promoter was defined by deletion, and appeared to be within 600 bp upstream from the putative transcription start site. It does not share significant homology with the other trypanosome promoters described so far (VSG, procyclin, rDNA), which all direct alpha-amanitin resistant transcription."
1777,Alpha-amanitin-resistant transcription units in trypanosomes: a comparison of promoter sequences for a VSG gene expression site and for the ribosomal RNA genes.,10.1093/nar/19.19.5153,1991-10-11,[],"Transcription of the predominant surface antigen genes in Trypanosoma brucei is unusual in its resistance to the RNA polymerase inhibitor alpha-amanitin, a property typical for rDNA transcription in eukaryotes. Transcription of most other protein-coding genes in trypanosomes is sensitive to alpha-amanitin. To investigate whether RNA polymerase I, the polymerase that transcribes rRNA genes, can give rise to functional mRNAs in trypanosomes, we have fused the putative promoter of the T.brucei rRNA genes to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene and determined CAT activity after transient expression of chimeric constructs in procyclic trypanosomes. We show here that the rRNA promoter yields the same high CAT activity as the promoters for the two predominant surface antigen genes of trypanosomes, the Variant-specific Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) gene of bloodstream trypanosomes and the procyclin gene of insect-form trypanosomes, both of which are also transcribed by an alpha-amanitin-insensitive RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase I of trypanosomes seems therefore able to synthesize pre-mRNAs that are effectively processed into translatable mRNAs. Dissection of the promoter segments showed the minimal elements for a VSG gene expression site promoter to be confined to a segment of -60 to +77 bp, overlapping the most 5' putative transcription start sites as determined in vivo by RNase protection experiments. For the ribosomal promoter region a segment of -258 to +200 bp relative to the putative transcription start site was sufficient for maximal CAT activity. There is a precise requirement for specific nucleotides at the rRNA transcription start site. We detect no homology between the sequences required for promoter function of the three alpha-amanitin-resistant transcription units, rRNA, VSG and procyclin (parp) genes. This suggests that the sequence-specific recognition of these promoters either occurs by common factors detecting sequence homologies that escape us, or by separate factors that bind to different DNA sequences but interact with a common alpha-amanitin-resistant RNA polymerase."
1778,Suppression by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense of the capacities of human T lymphocytes to express interleukin-2 receptors and proliferate after mitogenic stimulation.,10.1128/iai.59.10.3518-3522.1991,1991-10-01,[],"We studied the suppressive effects induced in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by purified blood forms of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The parasite was found to markedly impair lymphocyte proliferation (measured in terms of [3H]thymidine incorporation). The extent of this effect increased with parasite concentration and was not due to mitogen absorption, depletion of medium nutrients, or PBMC killing by the parasite. Significant reductions in interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression, determined by flow cytometric analysis, were also observed in PHA-stimulated PBMC cultured in the presence of T. b. rhodesiense as evidenced by marked decreases in the surface density of the receptor. Concomitant decreases in the percentage of IL-2R+ cells were recorded in approximately half of the experiments. A discrete, dimly stained subpopulation of IL-2R+ cells were consistently demonstrable whether or not a reduction in the percentage of IL-2R+ cells occurred. Living, but not glutaraldehyde-fixed, parasites suppressed IL-2R expression. In kinetic studies, a low but reproducible level of suppression of IL-2R was demonstrable as early as 6 h after PHA stimulation; the extent of this effect became considerably more pronounced as additional culture time elapsed. Levels of IL-2 biological activity in cocultures of T. b. rhodesiense with PHA-stimulated PBMC were comparable with or higher than those present in control cultures lacking the parasite. Therefore, insufficient levels of this cytokine would be an unlikely explanation for the noted suppression of IL-2R expression and lymphoproliferation. These effects of T. b. rhodesiense could represent an important component of the mechanism by which immunosuppression develops in African sleeping sickness."
1779,"Pentamidine concentrations in plasma, whole blood and cerebrospinal fluid during treatment of Trypanosoma gambiense infection in Côte d'Ivoire.",10.1016/0035-9203(91)90364-5,1991-09-01,[],"Pentamidine concentrations in plasma, whole blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were determined in 11 patients with Trypanosoma gambiense infection without involvement of the central nervous system in Côte d'Ivoire. Blood samples were drawn during a 48 h period after the first and last dose of pentamidine dimesylate given as 10 intramuscular injections on alternate days. Maximum plasma concentrations were generally attained within one hour after injection but varied extensively (420-13420 nmol/litre). The median plasma concentration 48 h after the last dose was approximately 5 times higher than that after the first dose. The ratio between whole blood and plasma concentration was approximately 2. Small amounts of the drug were found in the CSF after the last dose. The findings showed inter-individual differences in the pharmacokinetics of pentamidine. The currently recommended daily dose regimen could be questioned, as drug accumulation was pronounced. All patients were cured and the concentrations attained should be considered as parasiticidal. Further studies on the kinetics and distribution after single and multiple doses of pentamidine as well as studies on the possible relationship between adverse effects and plasma concentrations are, however, needed."
1780,The mitochondrial ATP synthase of Trypanosoma brucei: developmental regulation through the life cycle.,10.1016/0003-9861(91)90228-b,1991-08-01,[],"The mitochondrial H(+)-ATPase of the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei is shown to be developmentally regulated through the T. brucei life cycle as has been shown for components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. We have substantiated our results by assaying not only for oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity but also by determining the level of ATP synthetic activity. These results show that the level of ATPase present in the procyclic form of T. brucei is increased by at least threefold from that of the early bloodstream form while the ATPase activity in the late bloodstream form is only about twofold higher than the early form. ATP synthesis activity shows these same results. We have determined the level of ATP synthase protein present in the life cycle stages by Western analysis employing the antibodies that we have raised against both the water soluble F1 and the membrane-associated F0 moieties which we have purified from T. brucei. The Western blots of the procyclic form show strong reactivity with both the F0 and F1 antibodies. The other two life cycle stages, the early and the late bloodstream forms, show considerably less reactivity, paralleling the activity results. Electron micrographs of the sonicated mitochondrial fraction show inverted vesicles which are studded with knobby H(+)-ATPase in the procyclic form. The early bloodstream vesicles show very few of these characteristic structures, while the late bloodstream form shows a range of vesicles from nearly nude to partially studded."
1783,Characterization of a novel developmentally regulated gene from Trypanosoma brucei encoding a potential phosphoprotein.,10.1016/0166-6851(91)90154-x,1991-07-01,[],"We have isolated a cDNA clone corresponding to a single-copy nuclear gene that is upregulated at the mRNA level during in vitro differentiation of bloodstream trypomastigotes of strains of both Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense to procyclic forms. Transcript levels begin to increase within minutes of introduction of bloodstream forms into culture and peak well before cultures exhibit a procyclic morphology. This increase in transcript levels was found to occur both in the absence of protein synthesis and in a nontransforming strain blocked very early in the developmental program, both conditions under which accumulation of procyclic acidic repetitive protein (PARP) transcripts did not occur in control experiments. DNA sequence analysis reveals an open reading frame sufficient to encode a protein of approximately 50 kDa within the cDNA, but data base searches for homology at either the amino acid or nucleotide level revealed no related sequences. A high density of kinase consensus target sites in the deduced amino acid sequence suggests that the gene product may be a phosphoprotein."
1785,An analog of myristic acid with selective toxicity for African trypanosomes.,10.1126/science.1829548,1991-06-28,[],"Trypanosoma brucei, the protozoan parasite responsible for African sleeping sickness, evades the host immune response through the process of antigenic variation. The variant antigen, known as the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), is anchored to the cell surface by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) structure that contains myristate (n-tetradecanoate) as its only fatty acid component. The utilization of heteroatom-containing analogs of myristate was studied both in a cell-free system and in vivo. Results indicated that the specificity of fatty acid incorporation depends on chain length rather than on hydrophobicity. One analog, 10-(propoxy)decanoic acid, was highly toxic to trypanosomes in culture although it is nontoxic to mammalian cells."
1787,Assembly and deacetylation of N-acetylglucosaminyl-plasmanylinositol in normal and affected paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria cells.,10.1073/pnas.88.9.3762,1991-05-01,[],"Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) is anchored in cell membranes by a glycosyl-plasmanylinositol (GPI) moiety that is transferred to it en bloc in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. To analyze the biochemical reactions involved in preassembly of this structure, a human hematopoietic cell-free system was employed. Incubation of cell extracts with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc and butanol partitioning of reaction mixtures yielded two products similar in TLC mobility to intermediates described in Trypanosoma brucei. Both species were sensitive to Bacillus thuringiensis phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, indicative of association of [3H]GlcNAc label with a plasmanylinositol-containing acceptor. In contrast to trypanosome intermediates, which contain phosphatidylinositol (1,2-diacylglycerophosphoinositol), however, alkali treatment and phospholipase A2 digestion generated butanol-phase products characteristic of glycosylated plasmanylinositol (1-alkyl-2-acylglycerophosphoinositol). Kinetic and pulse-chase experiments indicated that the slower-migrating species was a product of the faster and that it, but not the faster, was sensitive to both GPI-specific phospholipase D and nitrous acid deamination, consistent with conversion of GlcNAc- to GlcN-plasmanylinositol. Accordingly, acetic anhydride acetylation retransformed the slower species back to the faster. Further incubation with cell extracts converted the slower species into more polar products. Lysates of normal and of affected blood leukocytes from two paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients supported assembly of the two intermediates within 1 min. Thus, the initial enzymes mediating human GPI-anchor assembly are GlcNAc-plasmanylinositol transferase and GlcNAc-plasmanylinositol deacetylase, their substrates contain plasmanylinositols, and the products of their activities are normal in affected PNH cells."
1788,"High level expression in Escherichia coli of soluble, enzymatically active schistosomal hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and trypanosomal ornithine decarboxylase.",10.1073/pnas.88.6.2500,1991-03-15,[],"The bacterial alkaline phosphatase (phoA) promoter and signal peptide have been used previously to control recombinant expression and secretion of eukaryotic proteins in Escherichia coli. Other reports have shown that this expression system can generate relatively modest levels of active hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT; hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; IMP:pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase, EC 2.4.2.8), which carries part of the signal peptide but remains in the cytosol of the bacteria. Herein, the phoA promoter without its associated signal peptide is used to regulate expression of the HPRT of Schistosoma mansoni and the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC; L-ornithine carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.17) of Trypanosoma brucei, two enzymes that have been identified as potential targets for antiparasitic chemotherapy. The levels of recombinant expression range from 20% to 60% of the total bacterial protein, and the majority of both recombinant enzymes was soluble. The specific activity for the recombinant trypanosomal ODC was one-third to two-thirds that of the authentic native enzyme and yields were predicted to be 15-30 mg of active enzyme per liter of bacterial culture. The specific activity for the recombinant schistosomal HPRT was equivalent to that for the native enzyme purified from schistosomes and up to 10 mg of enzymatically active HPRT has been purified from a 0.5-liter culture of treated bacteria. These results represent a break-through in recombinant expression of HPRT and ODC."
1790,Protein methylases in Trypanosoma brucei brucei: activities and response to DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine.,10.1099/00221287-137-3-717,1991-03-01,[],"Protein methylases I, II and III were detected in extracts of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, and characterized according to the specific amino substituent methylated. Only protein methylase II activity was elevated by difluoromethylornithine treatment of T. b. brucei, and hence this enzyme was characterized further. Protein methylase II transferred methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (S-AdoMet) to the carboxyl residues of several protein substrates, exhibiting highest activity with histone VIII-S (arginine-rich subgroup f3). The crude enzyme had an apparent Km for histone VIII-S of 28 mg ml-1 (11.4 mM-aspartyl and 18.4 mM-glutamyl residues methylated), and an apparent Km for S-AdoMet of 8.4 microM. T. b. brucei protein methylase II was sensitive to inhibition by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and its analogue sinefungin with apparent Ki values of 12.9 and 1.6 microM, respectively. Using a partially purified preparation, analysis of kinetic data in the presence and absence of sinefungin indicated that this analogue acts as a competitive inhibitor of the S-AdoMet binding site, and as a non-competitive inhibitor of the (protein) histone VIII-S binding site. The possible role of the enzyme in morphological control and its potential as a chemotherapeutic target are discussed."
1792,Antitrypanosomal effects of polyamine biosynthesis inhibitors correlate with increases in Trypanosoma brucei brucei S-adenosyl-L-methionine.,10.1042/bj2740527,1991-03-01,[],"We reported recently that administration of ([(Z)-4-amino-2-butenyl]methylamino)-5'-deoxyadenosine (MDL 73811), an enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor of S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC; EC 4.1.1.50), a key enzyme in the synthesis of spermidine, cures African trypanosome infections in mice. The precise mechanism of action of MDL 73811 was not clear because a rapid disappearance of trypanosomes from the bloodstream of treated rats occurred before significant depletion of spermidine. Administration of MDL 73811 to Trypanosoma brucei brucei-infected rats resulted in a 70% decrease in parasitaemia within 1 h and a complete disappearance of parasites by 5 h. The reduction in parasitaemia was accompanied by complete inhibition of AdoMetDC activity by 10 min after injection of MDL 73811; inhibition was sustained for at least 4 h. Polyamine levels in trypanosomes were unaffected during the first 1 h in which the marked decrease in parasitaemia was observed, but parasite AdoMet levels increased 20-fold within this time. In contrast, exposure of cultured mammalian cells to MDL 73811 resulted in only a 1.5-2-fold increase in AdoMet levels over a 6 h time course. Experiments with inhibitors of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) also suggested that the increased AdoMet levels might be an important factor for antitrypanosomal efficacy. Trypanosomes taken from rats treated for 36 h with eflornithine, an inhibitor of ODC, were depleted of putrescine and had markedly decreased spermidine levels. These organisms also had less than 10% of control AdoMetDC activity, and had elevated decarboxy AdoMet (greater than 4000-fold) and AdoMet (up to 50-fold) levels. The methyl ester of alpha-monofluromethyl-3,4-dehydro-ornithine (delta-MFMO-CH3), which cures murine T. b. brucei infections, and the ethyl ester analogue of this compound (delta-MFMO-C2H5), which does not cure this infection, become ODC inhibitors upon hydrolysis and thus were tested for their effects on trypanosomal polyamines, AdoMet and decarboxy AdoMet levels. Although both esters of delta-MFMO depleted trypanosomal polyamines, AdoMet and decarboxy AdoMet levels were elevated in T. b. brucei from infected mice treated with delta-MFMO-CH3 but not in parasites from mice treated with the delta-MFMO-C2H5. These data suggest that inhibition of AdoMetDC, either directly with MDL 73811 or indirectly with inhibitors of ODC, apparently leads to a trypanosome-specific elevation of AdoMet. It is possible that major changes in AdoMet, rather than changes in polyamines, may be responsible for the antitrypanosomal effects of these drugs."
1793,The in vitro differentiation of pleomorphic Trypanosoma brucei from bloodstream into procyclic form requires neither intermediary nor short-stumpy stage.,10.1016/0166-6851(91)90012-u,1991-02-01,[],"Our studies on the in vitro differentiation of a pleomorphic Trypanosoma brucei strain TREU667 indicate that the parasite differentiates directly from long-slender into procyclic form when incubated in Cunningham's medium at 26 degrees C. The intermediary and the short-stumpy bloodstream forms harvested from infected mice can also differentiate directly into procylic form in vitro with time courses similar to that for the long-slender form. Thus, none of the three bloodstream forms appear to be significantly better preadapted for differentiation. Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates cis-aconitate and L-citrate can shorten the initial lag phase of the differentiation, but an essential trigger appears to be the temperature shift from 37 degrees C to 26 degrees C, when other TCA cycle intermediates such as L-proline, L-malate, alpha-ketoglutarate, fumarate and succinate are present in Cunningham's medium. The ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in T. brucei showed a gradual increase and the ODC mRNA level remained constant during the differentiation. DL-alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), putrescine, dibutyryl cAMP and theophylline all exerted no discernible effect on the in vitro process, which suggests that neither cAMP increase nor polyamine depletion could be counted among the triggers of T. brucei differentiation. A monomorphic T. brucei strain EATRO110 was tested in the same medium at 26 degrees C but was unable to differentiate."
1794,A novel suicide inhibitor strategy for antiparasitic drug development.,10.1002/jcb.240450111,1991-01-01,[],"DL-alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a suicide inhibitor of eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), has therapeutic activities against African trypanosomiasis. The Ki value of DFMO for ODC of Trypanosoma brucei is somewhat higher than that for mouse ODC. The therapeutic efficacy of DFMO cannot therefore be attributed to a preferential inhibition of the parasite enzyme. The T. brucei gene encoding ODC was cloned and sequenced, and the derived amino acid sequence has 61.5% homology with that of mouse ODC, except that the C-terminal 36 amino acids of the mouse enzyme are missing from the parasite enzyme. The cloned T. brucei and mouse ODC genes were expressed in ODC-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) where the T. brucei enzyme was stable, but mouse ODC was unstable. Thus, the observed difference in intracellular stability is a property of the ODC protein itself, rather than of the cellular environment in which it is expressed. A chimeric ODC composed of the amino terminus of trypanosome ODC and the C-terminus of mouse ODC also was rapidly degraded in CHO cells, suggesting that peptide sequences in the mouse ODC carboxy-terminus determine its stability. The relatively slow turnover of the parasite enzyme constitutes the basis of selective antitrypanosomal action of DFMO. By this same token, many other proteins known to perform crucial functions in bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths, etc., also may have shorter half-lives in the mammalian hosts than in parasites. Suicide inhibitors of these proteins may have desirable characteristics as good chemotherapeutic agents. This new approach could provide an additional strategy for controlling infectious diseases."
1795,Endopeptidase variations among different life-cycle stages of African trypanosomes.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15693.x,1991-01-01,[],"Lysates of different life-cycle stages of Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma brucei were analysed for endopeptidase activity, using reaction conditions which permitted a distinction to be made between lysosomal and non-lysosomal activity [Lonsdale-Eccles, J. D. & Grab, D. J. (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 169, 467-475]. Hydrolysis of Z-Arg-Arg-NHMec (Z = benzyloxycarbonyl, NHMec = 7-amino-4-methylcoumaryl) and Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-NHMec occurred predominantly at alkaline pH and was observed in lysates of both insect and mammalian infective forms of T. brucei and T. congolense. Compared to their other life-cycle stages, procyclic forms of T. brucei and epimastigote forms of T. congolense exhibited enhanced hydrolysis of these substrates. Low levels of hydrolysis of Z-Arg-Arg-NHMec were observed in the bloodstream and epimastigote forms of T. vivax. The hydrolysis of Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-NHMec in each of the life-cycle stages of T. vivax was generally below detectable levels. In lysates of T. congolense, proteolytic and Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec-hydrolytic activity in bloodstream forms greater than metacyclic greater than epimastigote greater than procyclic forms. In T. vivax Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec-hydrolytic activity differed slightly according to the origin of the parasite but, in general, followed the same pattern (i.e. bloodstream forms greater than epimastigote forms, with metacyclic forms usually intermediate between these two). In T. brucei, Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec-hydrolytic activity in bloodstream forms greater than procyclic forms. Upon differentiation of the long, slender bloodstream forms into short, stumpy forms the Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec-hydrolytic activity was elevated even further. Thus, during their life cycle, each of these African trypanosomes exhibits complex changes of endopeptidase activity, suggestive of an induction of lysosomal activity between the insect and mammalian forms."
1799,The mitochondrial ATP synthase of Trypanosoma brucei: isolation and characterization of the intact F1 moiety.,10.1016/0166-6851(90)90137-b,1990-11-01,[],"This report describes the first isolation and molecular characterization of the mitochondrial F1-ATPase from Trypanosoma brucei. The isolation procedure utilized is a modified chloroform extraction procedure. In contrast to earlier reports on the F1-ATPase from other trypanosomatids, the F1-ATPase we have isolated from the procyclic form of T. brucei a complex composed of five distinct subunits. Apparent molecular weights of these subunits are 55,000 [alpha], 42,000 [beta], 32,000 [gamma], 22,000 [delta], and 17,000 [epsilon]. The F1 moiety which possesses the active site of the H(+)-ATPase has an ATPase activity in the standard Tris-HCl coupled enzyme assay with a Vmax of 22.96 mumol min-1 (mg protein)-1 and a Km value of 0.60 mM. This ATPase activity is cold labile and is not susceptible to oligomycin inhibition as is the membrane bound enzyme. Upon reconstitution with F1-ATPase depleted membranes (urea particles) the ATPase regains oligomycin sensitivity to the same extent as that found in the intact inner membrane vesicles. ATP synthesis is also restored to these particles upon reconstitution with F1. These results indicate that this F1-ATPase as isolated is intact with respect to all the critical H(+)-ATPase functions."
1800,"Degradation, recycling, and shedding of Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoprotein.",10.1111/j.1550-7408.1990.tb01263.x,1990-11-01,[],"Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms express a densely packed surface coat consisting of identical variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) molecules. This surface coat is subject to antigenic variation by sequential expression of different VSG genes and thus enables the cells to escape the mammalian host's specific immune response. VSG turnover was investigated and compared with the antigen switching rate. Living cells were radiochemically labeled with either 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent or 35S-methionine, and immunogold-surface labeled for electron microscopy studies. The fate of labeled VSG was studied during subsequent incubation or cultivation of labeled trypanosomes. Our data show that living cells slowly released VSG into the medium with a shedding rate of 2.2 +/- 0.6% h-1 (t1/2 = 33 +/- 9 h). In contrast, VSG degradation accounted for only 0.3 +/- 0.06% h-1 (t1/2 = 237 +/- 45 h) and followed the classical lysosomal pathway as judged by electron microscopy. Since VSG uptake by endocytosis was rather high, our data suggest that most of the endocytosed VSG was recycled to the surface membrane. These results indicate that shedding of VSG at a regular turnover rate is sufficient to remove the old VSG coat within one week, and no increase of the VSG turnover rate seems to be necessary during antigenic variation."
1802,Study of proteolytic activities released by incubation of trypanosomes (Trypanosoma brucei brucei) in pH 5.5 and pH 7.0 phosphate/glucose buffers.,10.1016/0304-4165(90)90102-3,1990-09-14,[],"Proteolytic activities released by overnight incubation of Antwerpeen Trypanozoon antigenic type (AnTat) 1.1 trypanosomes at 4 degrees C in pH 5.5 and pH 7.0 phosphate/glucose buffers were analyzed in the supernatants obtained after centrifugation of the parasite suspensions. The assays used the fluorogenic substrates N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-phenyl-alanyl-L-arginine-7-amido-4- methylcoumarin (Z-Phe-Arg-NMec) and N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-arginyl-L-arginine-7- amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z-Arg-Arg-NMec) at two different pHs (6.0 and 8.3). Z-Phe-Arg-NMec hydrolysis was inhibited by 2 microM L-trans-epoxysuccinyllencylamido(4-guanidino)butane (E-64) to a greater extent in the pH 7.0 supernatant than in the pH 5.5 supernatant. Z-Arg-Arg-NMec hydrolysis by the two supernatants was not significantly inhibited by 2 microM E-64. At pH 8.3 this activity was increased more than 2-fold by the addition of dithiothreitol. The hydrolysis activities were analyzed in collected eluates after fractionation of the supernatants by gel permeation high-performance liquid chromatography. Z-Phe-Arg-NMec hydrolytic activity inhibited by 2 microM E-64 was maximal at a retention time of 33 min (approx. Mr 30,000). In addition, a hydrolytic activity against the substrates Z-Phe-Arg-NMec and Z-Arg-Arg-NMec gave a peak showing a maximum at a retention time of 29 min (approx. Mr 70,000)."
1803,Stability and reconstitution of the soluble variant surface glycoprotein (sVSG) from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1021/bi00488a004,1990-09-11,[],"Soluble variant surface glycoprotein (sVSG) is the form of the coat protein of Trypanosoma brucei released by cleavage of its lipid anchor. As shown by ultracentrifugal analysis, the protein of the variant clone MITat 1.2 is a stable dimer of (117 +/- 6)-kDa molecular mass. Its quaternary structure remains unaltered in the concentration range from 0.01 to approximately 50 mg/mL. Further extrapolation to the in situ concentration on the cell surface points to no significant protein association beyond the dimer, because after correction for solution viscosity sedimentation velocity is independent of the protein concentration. The sedimentation constant, s20,w = 5.1 X 10(-13) s, together with the particle weight confirms the high anisotropy of the dimer. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra show the typical properties of an alpha-helical protein (51% alpha-helix) with fluorophores buried in the hydrophobic interior of the protein. Denaturation at extremes of pH leads to the monomer still maintaining a relatively compact structure. Increased concentrations of urea and guanidine hydrochloride cause randomization with cooperative transitions at 1.7 and 0.7 M, respectively. The yield of reconstitution of the denatured protein reaches 87% under optimum conditions. The final product is indistinguishable from the native protein in its spectral, hydrodynamic, and immunochemical properties. Immunological analysis included polyclonal antibodies as well as monoclonal antibodies raised against epitopes in the surface of the complete trypanosome, as well as cryptic epitopes exposed only on sVSG in solution. The kinetics of reconstitution involve sequential uni-bimolecular processes, corresponding to consecutive folding and subunit association. About 38% of the fluorescence of the native protein is recovered within the mixing time (secondary structure formation).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
1804,Synchronous differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei from bloodstream to procyclic forms in vitro.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1990.tb19237.x,1990-09-11,[],"The differentiation of mammalian stage Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms comprising predominantly parasites of intermediate and stumpy morphology to the procyclic forms characteristic for the insect midgut stage was studied in vitro. Differentiation of the cell population occurred synchronously as judged by the synthesis of the surface glycoprotein, procyclin, characteristic of the arising procyclic forms and the loss of the membrane-form variant surface glycoprotein, the coat protein of bloodstream forms. The change in surface antigens took place within 12 h in the absence of cell growth; subsequently, the procyclic cells divided exponentially. As defined in this study, T. brucei may be a useful model to follow other changes in gene expression, metabolism or ultrastructure during differentiation of a unicellular eucaryote."
1805,Characterization of an in vitro assay for import of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase into the glycosomes of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1128/mcb.10.9.4545-4554.1990,1990-09-01,[],"Glycosomes are microbody organelles found in kinetoplastida, where they serve to compartmentalize the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. In order to identify the mechanism by which these enzymes are targeted to the glycosome, we have modified the in vitro import assay developed by Dovey et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2598-2602, 1988). This assay measures the uptake of in vitro-translated Trypanosoma brucei glycosomal 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (gPGK) by purified glycosomes. Up to 50% of the total 35S-gPGK in the glycosomal fraction was resistant to extraction by 3 M urea or treatment with proteinase K (500 micrograms/ml). The glycosome-associated 35S-gPGK could be chemically cross-linked to the endogenous glycosomal proteins to form a sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant complex, suggesting that it is close to the intraglycosomal protein matrix. Deoxycholate solubilized the glycosome and thereby rendered the glycosome-associated 35S-gPGK fully susceptible to proteinase K. However, the glycosome-associated 35S-gPGK was not digested by proteinase K in the presence of Triton X-100, which cannot dissolve the glycosomal protein core. The 35S-gPGK synthesized in vitro was able to bind directly to protein cores, where it became resistant to urea extraction and proteinase K digestion. However, the 35S-gPGK-protein core complex exhibited a much higher density than the 35S-gPGK-glycosome complex and was readily separable in sucrose gradients. Thus, in our in vitro import assay, the 35S-gPGK appeared to associate with intact glycosomes, possibly reflecting import of protein into the organelle. Complete denaturation of the 35S-gPGK in 8 M urea prior to the assay enhanced the efficiency of its association with glycosomes. Native gPGK did not compete with the association of in vitro-translated gPGK unless it was denatured. The assay exhibited time and temperature dependence, but it did not require externally added ATP and was not inhibited by the nonhydrolyzable analogs adenosine-5'-(beta,gamma-imido)-triphosphate and gamma-S-ATP. However, the presence of 20 to 30 microM ATP inside the glycosome may fulfill the requirement for protein import."
1807,Cure of Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense infections in mice with an irreversible inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase.,10.1128/AAC.34.8.1485,1990-08-11,[],"A structural analog, 5'-([(Z)-4-amino-2-butenyl]methylamino)-5'-deoxy adenosine (MDL 73811), of decarboxy S-adenosyl-L-methionine, the product of the reaction catalyzed by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) decarboxylase (DC), was found to inhibit Trypanosoma brucei brucei AdoMet DC. The inhibition was time dependent (tau 50, 0.3 min), exhibited pseudo-first-order kinetics (Ki, 1.5 microM), and was apparently irreversible. The natural substrate of the reaction, AdoMet, protected the enzyme from inactivation, suggesting that MDL 73811 was directed at the enzyme active site and was probably catalytically activated. Administration of MDL 73811 to T. b. brucei-infected rats resulted in rapid inhibition of AdoMet DC activity, a decrease in spermidine, and an increase in putrescine in the trypanosomes isolated from treated rats. Treatment of T. b. brucei-infected mice with MDL 73811 (20 mg/kg of body weight intraperitoneally twice daily for 4 days) resulted in cures of the trypanosome infections. Additionally, drug-resistant T. brucei rhodesiense infections in mice were cured by either a combination of MDL 73811 (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally three times per day for 5 days) and relatively low oral doses of alpha-difluoromethylornithine or MDL 73811 (50 mg/kg per day for 7 days) administered alone in implanted miniosmotic pumps. These data suggest that MDL 73811 and, perhaps, other inhibitors of AdoMet DC have potential for therapeutic use in various forms of African trypanosomiasis."
1809,T-cell-independent and T-cell-dependent B-cell responses to exposed variant surface glycoprotein epitopes in trypanosome-infected mice.,10.1128/iai.58.7.2337-2342.1990,1990-07-01,[],"The T-cell dependency of B-cell responses to variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) epitopes exposed in their native surface conformation on Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense clone LouTat 1 was investigated. T-cell requirements were examined by analyses of gamma globulin preparations derived from trypanosome-infected BALB/c nude (nu/nu) and thymus-intact (nu/+) mice. A radioimmunoassay was used to selectively quantitate antibody binding to native VSG 1 epitopes present on the surface of viable trypanosomes. Such analyses of VSG-specific antibody in infected mice demonstrated that in the absence of T cells there was a significant B-cell response to exposed VSG epitopes; however, in the presence of T cells these surface epitope-specific responses were greatly enhanced. In contrast to infection, immunization of mice with purified VSG 1 or paraformaldehyde-fixed parasites elicited significant VSG surface epitope-specific responses only in the presence of T cells (i.e., in nu/+ mice only). VSG-specific antibody responses in mice infected with three other clonal T. brucei rhodesiense populations (LouTat 1.2, 1.5, and 1.9) were found to be similar in this pattern, although not identical, to the anti-LouTat 1 responses. An important exception was that mice infected with LouTat 1.8 required T cells to produce VSG surface-specific antibody. Thus, the VSG surface epitope-specific B-cell responses in trypanosome-infected mice represent composite T-cell-independent and T-cell-dependent processes, and a significantly stronger response is made in the presence of T cells. However, immunization with VSG in the absence of infection elicited only T-cell-dependent responses. Since the relative contribution of T-cell-independent and T-cell-dependent processes to the total VSG-specific antibody produced during infection was variable (as seen with the absence of a T-cell-independent response to LouTat 1.8), this may reflect differences in the primary structure or display of VSG molecules on the trypanosome membrane or may represent active parasite interference with some epitope-specific B-cell responses."
1813,Variant surface glycoprotein of Trypanosoma brucei brucei AnTat 1.1: influence of the isolation conditions upon the disulfide linked dimer/monomer ratio.,10.1016/0305-0491(90)90077-7,1990-01-01,[],"1. Using the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) isolation procedure described by Baltz et al. ([1976] Ann. Immunol. (Inst. Pasteur) 127 C, 761-774) which involves suspension of the trypanosomes in a pH 5.5 buffer, the Antwerpen trypanozoon antigenic type (AnTat) 1.1 VSG is mainly obtained as a disulfide linked dimeric form with a trace amount of a monomeric form. 2. The use of a parasite suspension buffer at pH 7.0 results in a slight decrease of the VSG dimer/monomer ratio. 3. pH 5.5 and 7.0 supernatants of centrifuged parasite suspensions were submitted to kinetic incubations at different temperatures and pH, and we found conditions involving transformation of the AnTat 1.1 VSG dimer into the AnTat 1.1 VSG monomer (shifting the pH 5.5 supernatant to pH 7.0 and incubation at room temperature). 4. This transformation of the AnTat 1.1 VSG dimer into the AnTat 1.1 VSG monomer is activated by the addition of 1 mM reduced glutathione, and is inhibited by the addition of 1 mM oxidized glutathione or 0.1 mM N-ethylmaleimide or cadmium acetate."
1819,Stable ornithine decarboxylase in promastigotes of Leishmania mexicana mexicana.,10.1016/0006-291x(89)92664-8,1989-06-15,[],"Studies on the decarboxylation of ornithine in Leishmania mexicana have shown that this activity corresponds to a true ornithine decarboxylase rather than to an oxidative decarboxylation or aminotransferase reaction, both of which also give rise to the release of CO2. The stoichiometric relationship between substrate and products has indicated that extracts of L. mexicana were able to catalyse the formation of an unknown compound besides putrescine and CO2. The addition of cycloheximide to cultures of L. mexicana allowed us to demonstrate that ornithine decarboxylase degradation in vivo was extremely slow in this parasite. This remarkable stability of the enzyme is only comparable to that found in Trypanosoma brucei and contrasts with the high turnover rate of ornithine decarboxylases of different mammalian cells."
1820,Trypanothione is the primary target for arsenical drugs against African trypanosomes.,10.1073/pnas.86.8.2607,1989-04-01,[],"The trypanosomatid metabolite N1,N8-bis-(glutathionyl)spermidine (trypanothione) has been demonstrated to form a stable adduct with the aromatic arsenical drug melarsen oxide [p-(4,6-diamino-s-triazinyl-2-yl)aminophenyl arsenoxide]. The stability constant of the melarsen-trypanothione adduct (Mel T) has been determined to be 1.05 x 10(7) M-1. When bloodstream Trypanosoma brucei are incubated with either melarsen oxide or the 2,3-dimercaptopropanol adduct of melarsen oxide (melarsoprol), Mel T is the only arsenical derivative detectable in acid-soluble extracts of the cells. Trypanothione may therefore be regarded as a primary target for aromatic arsenical derivatives against African trypanosomes. The selective toxic action of these compounds might arise through sequestration of intracellular trypanothione in the form of Mel T, or Mel T itself may be toxic within the cell. The latter possibility is illustrated by the finding that Mel T is an inhibitor of trypanothione reductase from T. brucei (Ki = 9.0 microM)--an enzyme that is central to the regulation of the thiol/disulfide redox balance in the parasite and absent from the host."
1823,Procyclin gene expression and loss of the variant surface glycoprotein during differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1083/jcb.108.2.737,1989-02-01,[],"In the mammalian host, the unicellular flagellate Trypanosoma brucei is covered by a dense surface coat that consists of a single species of macromolecule, the membrane form of the variant surface glycoprotein (mfVSG). After uptake by the insect vector, the tsetse fly, bloodstream-form trypanosomes differentiate to procyclic forms in the fly midgut. Differentiation is characterized by the loss of the mfVSG coat and the acquisition of a new surface glycoprotein, procyclin. In this study, the change in surface glycoprotein composition during differentiation was investigated in vitro. After triggering differentiation, a rapid increase in procyclin-specific mRNA was observed. In contrast, there was a lag of several hours before procyclin could be detected. Procyclin was incorporated and uniformly distributed in the surface coat. The VSG coat was subsequently shed. For a single cell, it took 12-16 h to express a maximum level of procyclin at the surface while the loss of the VSG coat required approximately 4 h. The data are discussed in terms of the possible molecular arrangement of mfVSG and procyclin at the cell surface. Molecular modeling data suggest that a (Asp-Pro)2 (Glu-Pro)22-29 repeat in procyclin assumes a cylindrical shape 14-18 nm in length and 0.9 nm in diameter. This extended shape would enable procyclin to interdigitate between the mfVSG molecules during differentiation, exposing epitopes beyond the 12-15-nm-thick VSG coat."
1824,Release of the variant surface glycoprotein during differentiation of bloodstream to procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(89)90132-1,1989-01-01,[],"Investigations on the turnover of the membrane-form variant surface glycoprotein (mfVSG) of Trypanosoma brucei during cultivation in vitro of the monomorphic variant clones MIT at 1.2 and MIT at 1.4 showed that bloodstream forms slowly released the surface coat into the medium (time required to decline to half the initial amount, t50% = 32 +/- 3 h). VSG appeared in the medium in its soluble form (sVSG) which lacked the dimyristoylglycerol membrane anchor as judged by electrophoretic mobility and exposure of the cross-reacting determinant. The total VSG in the culture was very stable with a t50% = 189 +/- 24 h, compared to the other cellular proteins with a t50% approximately 28 h. Coat release during differentiation of bloodstream forms to procyclic cells could be distinguished from this turnover both by its more rapid kinetics (t50% = 13 +/- 1 h) and by the appearance in the medium of a predominant proteolytic fragment in addition to sVSG. Coat release during the transition to procyclic forms was not inhibited by the lysosomotropic agents ammonium chloride or chloroquine, by the proton ionophore monensin, or by the protease inhibitor tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone. The experiments demonstrate that coat release during differentiation is a specific cellular event distinct from simple turnover. The possibility is discussed that VSG release under both conditions occurs by endocytosis of mfVSG, degradation by a phospholipase C or a protease or both in a non-acidic intracellular compartment and recycling to the surface by exocytosis."

We have purified the LDL receptor of this species nearly to homogeneity (about 1000-fold purification) and obtained monospecific polyclonal antibodies against it. As analyzed by NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified receptor consists of a single subunit, with an apparent molecular mass of 86 kDa. Its isoelectric point is 5.9. On the average, each cell exposes 52,000 copies of low-affinity receptors (Kd of 250 nM) and 1800 copies of high-affinity receptors (Kd of 5.7 nM). According to indirect en bloc immunolabeling of fixed parasites, the receptor appears to be localized to the flagellar pocket membrane and the flagellar membrane and to be completely absent from the rest of the pericellular membrane. LDL is required for optimal growth of the trypanosome in vitro: cell growth can be inhibited either by removal of LDL from the culture medium or by antibodies against the purified LDL receptors. In both cases, growth is restored by the addition of excess LDL."
1831,Trypanosoma brucei sspp.: cleavage of variant specific and common glycoproteins during exposure of live cells to trypsin.,10.1016/0014-4894(88)90093-8,1988-08-01,[],"Intact bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, T.b. gambiense, and T.b. rhodesiense and procyclic forms of T.b. brucei and T.b. gambiense were incubated in trypsin, solubilized for gel electrophoresis, and analyzed for removal of surface molecules. Silver-stained gels and transfer blots probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated or radiolabeled lectins revealed that only three glycoproteins, Gp120p, Gp91p, and Gp23p, were removed from the surface of procyclic forms by trypsin. The variant specific glycoproteins, Gp23b, Gp120b, and in some clones Gp91b were surface molecules cleaved from bloodstream forms. Greater than 90% of the variant specific glycoprotein (VSG) was removed from the surface of all clones studied within 1 hr following the addition of trypsin. The removal of VSG was coincident with appearance of 37 to 50 kDa glycopeptide fragments of VSG with different clones yielding different sized fragments. Detailed kinetic analysis of proteins from whole cell extracts and supernatants of the DuTat 1.1 clone of T.b. rhodesiense using concanavalin A (Con A) and polyclonal antibodies revealed that three major VSG fragments were released during trypsinization. The electrophoretic mobility of the three VSG fragments of DuTat 1.1 was not altered when samples were boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate to inhibit the endogenous phospholipase C. Antiserum to the cross-reactive determinant bound to intact VSG, but did not bind VSG fragments. Thus, the major Con A binding fragments of DuTat 1.1 VSG and perhaps those of the other clones we studied were probably derived from the N-terminal domain of the molecule. The data suggest that VSG is cleaved by trypsin in situ at the hinge region, but remains attached to the cell surface via weak interaction with neighboring molecules."
1833,Acetylcholinesterases from Musca domestica and Drosophila melanogaster brain are linked to membranes by a glycophospholipid anchor sensitive to an endogenous phospholipase.,10.1111/j.1471-4159.1988.tb10587.x,1988-04-01,[],"The sensitivity of acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) from Musca domestica and from Drosophila melanogaster to the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus and to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Trypanosoma brucei was investigated. B. cereus phospholipase C solubilizes membrane-bound AChE, and both phospholipases convert amphiphilic AChEs into hydrophilic forms of the enzyme. The lipases uncover an immunological determinant that is found on other glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane proteins after the same treatment. This immunological determinant is also present on the native hydrophilic form of AChE. The polypeptide bearing the active site of the membrane-bound enzyme migrates faster during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis than the same polypeptide from the soluble enzyme. We conclude that AChE from insect brain is attached to membranes via a glycophospholipid anchor. This anchor is covalently linked to the polypeptide bearing the active esterase site of the enzyme and can be cleaved by an endogenous lipase."

1835,Intracellular transport of a variant surface glycoprotein in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1083/jcb.106.1.77,1988-01-01,[],"Trypanosome variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) have a novel glycan-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor, which is cleavable by a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. A similar structure serves to anchor some membrane proteins in mammalian cells. Using kinetic and ultrastructural approaches, we have addressed the question of whether this structure directs the protein to the cell surface by a different pathway from the classical one described in other cell types for plasma membrane and secreted glycoproteins. By immunogold labeling on thin cryosections we were able to show that, intracellularly, VSG is associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum, all Golgi cisternae, and tubulovesicular elements and flattened cisternae, which form a network in the area adjacent to the trans side of the Golgi apparatus. Our data suggest that, although the glycan-phosphatidylinositol anchor is added in the endoplasmic reticulum, VSG is nevertheless subsequently transported along the classical intracellular route for glycoproteins, and is delivered to the flagellar pocket, where it is integrated into the surface coat. Treatment of trypanosomes with 1 microM monensin had no effect on VSG transport, although dilation of the trans-Golgi stacks and lysosomes occurred immediately. Incubation of trypanosomes at 20 degrees C, a treatment that arrests intracellular transport from the trans-Golgi region to the cell surface in mammalian cells, caused the accumulation of VSG molecules in structures of the trans-Golgi network, and retarded the incorporation of newly synthesized VSG into the surface coat."
1838,Biochemical changes associated with alpha-difluoromethylornithine uptake and resistance in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(87)90086-7,1987-10-01,[],"Procyclic Trypanosoma brucei grown in semi-defined media are sensitive to alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) (EC50 100 microM), an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis. Organisms resistant to 5 mM DFMO (EC50 greater than 20 mM) were obtained by passage in incremental amounts of drug. Resistant and wild-type cells accumulated DFMO by passive diffusion with a consequent decrease in polyamine levels, indicating inhibition of ODC in both cell types. The resistant phenotype was stable in the absence of DFMO, in which state there was no increase in ODC abundance or activity. By kinetic analysis, the ODC of resistant cells appeared normal. In wild-type and resistant cells, [3H]DFMO equally and uniquely affinity-labelled a 50 kDa polypeptide corresponding to the ODC subunit. Levels of ODC and tubulin mRNAs were elevated 4-fold in resistant cells grown in the presence of DFMO, although there was no indication of gene amplification. The intracellular concentration of dihydrotrypanothione (N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)-spermidine), a redox intermediate unique to kinetoplastids, was unchanged in resistant cells growing in DFMO but was halved in wild-type cells exposed to DFMO for 48 h. The exceptionally elevated levels of ornithine found in DFMO-treated resistant cells most likely play a crucial role in cell survival by maintaining intracellular concentrations of dihydrotrypanothione by competing with DFMO for ODC."
1840,Purification and characterization of a tyrosine aminotransferase from Crithidia fasciculata.,10.1016/0166-6851(87)90012-0,1987-08-01,[],"Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT, EC 2.6.1.5) from the kinetoplastid, Crithidia fasciculata, was purified over 2000 fold to electrophoretic homogeneity. The native form of the enzyme had a molecular weight of approximately 100,000, whereas under denaturing conditions it produced two polypeptides of approximately 50,000 and 48,000, respectively. Absence of a reaction with the periodic acid-Schiff stain suggested that the crithidial enzyme was not a glycoprotein. It was relatively stable and remained active over a wide range of pH and temperature. It exhibited a broad substrate specificity and was able to utilize L-tyrosine, L-tryptophan, and L-phenylalanine as amino donors. Antiserum produced against partially purified crithidial tyrosine aminotransferase failed to inhibit the enzymatic activity. The same antiserum cross-reacted with a soluble extract from Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, but not with that from normal mouse liver, confirming evolutionary conservatism between the two protozoa."
1843,Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma brucei. Characterization and cellular location.,10.1042/bj2430661,1987-05-01,[],"Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase has been discovered in the bloodstream form of the eukaryotic African parasite, Trypanosoma brucei. The enzyme catalysed the stoichiometric oxidation of dihydrolipoamide by NAD+ and exhibited a hyperbolic dependence of catalytic activity on the concentrations of both dihydrolipoamide and NAD+. Chemical modification with the tervalent arsenical reagent p-aminophenyldichloroarsine indicates the involvement in catalysis of a reversibly reducible disulphide bond. Plasma-membrane sheets were purified from T. brucei, and it was shown that virtually all the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase remained closely associated with this membrane preparation. T. brucei apparently lacks the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes of which dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase is usually an integral component. In the context of this absence, the possible function of trypanosomal dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase is discussed, with particular reference to its cellular location in the plasma membrane."
1845,The rate of proliferation among African trypanosomes is a stable trait that is directly related to virulence.,10.4269/ajtmh.1987.36.533,1987-05-01,[],"The relationship between the growth rate of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and its virulence was investigated. A cloned, monomorphic, slow growing, and relatively avirulent line of T. b. gambiense was serially passaged at 3- to 5-day intervals through immunosuppressed mice. The growth rate measured within the first 2 patent days of infection did not vary significantly through the first 25 passages but by passage 50 had decreased significantly from 11.9 +/- 1.1 hr to 9.0 +/- 0.7 hr. A clone from passage 50 and three different second peak heterologous variants all had statistically similar growth rates, indicating that the rate of proliferation was a stable trait. With the faster rate of proliferation there was a corresponding increase in virulence. The inoculum necessary to kill 50% of normal outbred mice in the first peak of parasitemia (LD50) dropped significantly from 3 X 10(6) first passage parasites to 4 X 10(5) passage 50 parasites. The lethal load for both fast and slow growing organisms was the same (greater than 2 X 10(9) trypanosomes/ml of blood). To further link virulence and growth rate, a strong correlation (r = 0.89) was measured when generation times of 10 closely related lines of T. b. gambiense, and 2 lines of pleomorphic T. b. rhodesiense were compared to their LD50 values. While the rate of trypanosomal proliferation was similar between the day of inoculation through the second patent day, it slowed to 64% of that level once parasitemias exceeded 3 X 10(8) organisms/ml of host blood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
1846,In vivo labelling of intermediates in the discontinuous synthesis of mRNAs in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1002/j.1460-2075.1987.tb04858.x,1987-04-01,[],"Discontinuous mRNA synthesis in trypanosomes is thought to involve a 140-nucleotide precursor, called the mini-exon-derived RNA or medRNA, which contributes its 5' 35 nucleotides to the 5' end of nascent mRNAs. We used in vivo labelling of RNA to show that medRNA has a half-life of less than 6 min, whereas putative high mol. wt intermediates containing the 3' part of the medRNA have an average half-life of less than 1 min. This eliminates priming of pre-mRNA synthesis by intact medRNA as the main mode of discontinuous mRNA synthesis. Potential intermediates of 35 and 105 nucleotides were labelled in parallel with medRNA, but their significance could not be assessed in RNA preparations containing medRNA, as they are also produced by artefactual cleavage of medRNA. We show, however, that high mol. wt RNA, free of medRNA, can release medRNA segments upon a debranching treatment. These results are consistent with a trans splicing mechanism involving short-lived forked intermediates, analogous to lariats in cis splicing systems."
1847,"Difluoromethylornithine, an effective new treatment of Gambian trypanosomiasis. Results in five patients.",10.1016/0002-9343(87)90107-0,1987-03-23,[],"Recent studies have shown DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine (eflornithine), an inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, to be curative in various Trypanosoma species infections of laboratory animals. Five patients are described with Gambian trypanosomiasis treated in Belgium with difluoromethylornithine, using various intravenous and oral dosage schedules. Three patients had late-stage and two had early-stage disease. Difluoromethylornithine treatment was associated with clearing of parasites from blood within one to four days, a trend towards normalization of all altered biologic values associated with the disease, and marked amelioration of clinical symptoms. Side effects of difluoromethylornithine, including loose stools in three patients and both anemia, and a decrease in auditory acuity in one patient, were mild, transient, and never required interruption of drug treatment. The presence of difluoromethylornithine in cerebrospinal fluid, determined in three patients, demonstrated that difluoromethylornithine penetrates into the central nervous system. In three patients, follow-up of at least 24 months after treatment demonstrated a continued healthy state without evidence of relapse. These promising, albeit preliminary, results of difluoromethylornithine therapy, even in patients with central nervous system involvement, indicate that extended clinical trials are warranted to determine the optimal dosage regimen in patients with early- and late-stage disease."
1849,An assay of membrane-bound Trypanosoma brucei phospholipase using an integral membrane protein substrate and detergent phase separation.,10.1016/0166-6851(87)90180-0,1987-02-01,[],"The technique of phase separation in a solution of the non-ionic detergent Triton X-114 was used to measure the enzymatic conversion of a membrane protein to a soluble product via removal of a hydrophobic moiety. The substrate was the major surface protein (p63), of Leishmania promastigotes and the enzyme was a phospholipase C purified from Trypanosoma brucei. This membrane-bound enzyme is responsible for the cleavage of the hydrophobic lipid membrane anchor of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), of T. brucei. The assay is fast, simple and uses small amounts of reagents. It has been used to determine the pH optimum, thermal resistance, and the sensitivity to inhibitors of the trypanosomal phospholipase."
1850,Inhibition of growth and respiration of Leishmania mexicana by the antitumor agent lonidamine.,10.1016/0742-8413(87)90067-3,1987-01-01,[],"1. The antitumor drug lonidamine inhibited growth of promastigotes of Leishmania mexicana in axenic culture. 2. Fifty percent inhibition was attained at 0.42 mM, and was reflected mainly in an increase in lag time, with less effect on final cell yield. 3. The drug was leishmanistatic, since when a non-growing culture in the presence of 0.5 mM lonidamine was centrifuged and the cells resuspended in fresh medium, growth started and reached the control value. 4. Both coupled and FCCP-uncoupled respiration of intact promastigotes were inhibited by lonidamine; 50% inhibition was attained at 0.5 and 0.4 mM, respectively. 5. The results suggested that the mechanism of inhibition of growth of L. mexicana is, as proposed in the case of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes and Trypanosoma brucei procyclic trypomastigotes, through inhibition of the energy metabolism."
1853,The common 5' terminal sequence on trypanosome mRNAs: a target for anti-messenger oligodeoxynucleotides.,10.1093/nar/14.14.5605,1986-07-25,[],"Several mature mRNAs of Trypanosoma brucei were previously shown to have a common 5' terminal sequence of 35 nucleotides (nt) encoded by a separate mini-exon. To verify whether all trypanosome mRNAs contain this mini-exon sequence at their 5' end, we have tested oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to different parts of the 35 nt leader sequence for their ability to inhibit translation of total trypanosome mRNA. All oligomers tested inhibited translation of trypanosome mRNAs in a wheat germ extract. They had no effect on translation of Brome mosaic virus mRNA and of a trypanosome mRNA for phosphoglycerate kinase modified to remove the mini-exon sequence. Three different 12mers inhibited translation 35-60%; both the 22- and 34mer inhibited translation 95-100%. Incorporation of amino acids decreased proportionally in all protein bands detected in high resolution polyacrylamide gels. Our results show that all trypanosome mRNAs that yield a product detectable in gel contain a mini-exon sequence. We infer that most, if not all, trypanosome mRNAs contain a 5' terminal mini-exon sequence acquired by discontinuous synthesis."
1855,Posttranslational modification and intracellular transport of a trypanosome variant surface glycoprotein.,10.1083/jcb.103.1.255,1986-07-01,[],"After synthesis on membrane-bound ribosomes, the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of Trypanosoma brucei is modified by: (a) removal of an N-terminal signal sequence, (b) addition of N-linked oligosaccharides, and (c) replacement of a C-terminal hydrophobic peptide with a complex glycolipid that serves as a membrane anchor. Based on pulse-chase experiments with the variant ILTat-1.3, we now report the kinetics of three subsequent processing reactions. These are: (a) conversion of newly synthesized 56/58-kD polypeptides to mature 59-kD VSG, (b) transport to the cell surface, and (c) transport to a site where VSG is susceptible to endogenous membrane-bound phospholipase C. We found that the t 1/2 of all three of these processes is approximately 15 min. The comparable kinetics of these processes is compatible with the hypotheses that transport of VSG from the site of maturation to the cell surface is rapid and that VSG may not reach a phospholipase C-containing membrane until it arrives on the cell surface. Neither tunicamycin nor monensin blocks transport of VSG, but monensin completely inhibits conversion of 58-kD VSG to the mature 59-kD form. In the presence of tunicamycin, VSG is synthesized as a 54-kD polypeptide that is subsequently processed to a form with a slightly higher Mr. This tunicamycin-resistant processing suggests that modifications unrelated to N-linked oligosaccharides occur. Surprisingly, the rate of VSG transport is reduced, but not abolished, by dropping the chase temperature to as low as 10 degrees C."
1856,The membrane-anchoring systems of vertebrate acetylcholinesterase and variant surface glycoproteins of African trypanosomes share a common antigenic determinant.,10.1016/0014-5793(86)80476-8,1986-04-21,[],"Amphiphilic detergent-soluble acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from Torpedo is converted to a hydrophilic form by digestion with phospholipase C from Trypanosoma brucei or from Bacillus cereus. This lipase digestion uncovers an immunological determinant which crossreacts with a complex carbohydrate structure present in the hydrophilic form of all variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) of T. brucei. This crossreacting determinant is also detected in human erythrocyte AChE after digestion with T. brucei lipase. From these results we conclude that the glycophospholipid anchors of protozoan VSG and of AChE of the two vertebrates share common structural features, suggesting that this novel type of membrane anchor has been conserved during evolution."
1859,3'-nucleotidase activity in procyclic and bloodstream stages of Trypanosoma rhodesiense.,10.1016/0305-0491(86)90332-9,1986-01-01,[],"Both procyclic and bloodstream-derived trypanosomes of Trypanosoma rhodesiense exhibit a nucleotidase activity which is capable of hydrolyzing 3'-ribonucleotides. Nucleotidase activity in assays employing 5'-nucleotide substrates is not detectable in preparations of either phenotype. The 3'-nucleotidase activity in lysates of procyclic trypanosomes is pelletable at 100,000 g, whereas that activity from bloodstream forms is operationally soluble under the conditions employed. The 3'-nucleotidase activities of both stages share the following characteristics: pH optimum of 8.5, substrate preference for purine ribonucleotides, resistance to commonly used phosphatase inhibitors, including fluoride, tartrate and molybdate ions. Both activities are reversibly inhibited by EDTA and reactivated by Co2+ ions. As visualized by fine-structure cytochemical methods, 3'-nucleotidase activity was distributed over the entire surface of procyclic trypanosomes, but not bloodstream parasites bearing an intact surface coat."
1860,Pentamidine: a review.,10.1093/clinids/7.5.625,1985-09-01,[],"Pentamidine, recently released for clinical use, is effective in therapy for the hemolymphatic stage of Gambian trypanosomiasis, antimony-resistant leishmaniasis, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The mechanism of action is unclear and may differ for different organisms. Trypanosomes actively transport pentamidine intracellularly, and the drug may then interfere with DNA biosynthetics. However, pentamidine appears to kill nonreplicating P. carinii. The mechanism of killing is unexplained. The pharmacokinetics of pentamidine has been incompletely studied in humans. The estimated volume of distribution is 3 liters/kg. Levels in plasma of pentamidine range from 0.3-1.4 microgram/ml after standard 4 mg/kg dosing, with no appreciable increase in drug levels on successive dosing and no correlation between levels and creatinine clearance or adverse reactions. The drug appears to be concentrated in the kidney and excreted in the urine, with levels detectable six to eight weeks after cessation of therapy. Immediate adverse reactions have included hypotension, nausea, and vomiting. Local pain or abscess formation at an injection site, mild azotemia, leukopenia, abnormal findings from liver function tests, and hypoglycemia may also occur."
1862,Transport of ethanolamine and its incorporation into the variant surface glycoprotein of bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(85)90088-x,1985-06-01,[],"The membrane-attached form of the variant surface glycoprotein (mf-VSG) of bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei is anchored to the plasma membrane by a hydrophobic C-terminal lipo-oligosaccharide containing ethanolamine. Analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that several different cloned T. brucei strains (strain EATRO 110 and variants 117 and 118 of strain 427) incorporated [3H]ethanolamine into both mf-VSG and the soluble VSG derived from it, but not into other proteins. Other trypanosomatids, e.g. Leishmania mexicana promastigotes, T. cruzi epimastigotes, and T. brucei procyclic forms, did not incorporate ethanolamine into cellular proteins. Thus, [3H]ethanolamine can be used as a specific biosynthetic label for T. brucei VSG polypeptides. The time course of incorporation of [3H]ethanolamine into VSG showed a lag period of about 15 min. Double-labelling experiments using [3H]ethanolamine and H3[32P]O4 demonstrated that ethanolamine labelled only the C-terminal moiety and was not incorporated into other portions of the VSG molecule. Cellular uptake of ethanolamine occurred via a specific carrier-mediated transport system having a Vmax of 132 pmol min-1 mg-1 protein and a Km of 3.7 microM. The properties of this transport system are consistent with the possibility that ethanolamine is derived entirely from the host."

Since alpha-difluoromethylornithine is effective for the treatment of experimental and clinical African trypanosomiasis, it was possible that the more potent ornithine and putrescine analogs might be more active in treating the disease. However, only alpha-monofluoromethyldehydroornithine methyl ester was more potent than alpha-difluromethylornithine against mouse trypanosomiasis and warrants further study in model infections."

1866,A high affinity Ca2+-dependent ATPase in the surface membrane of the bloodstream stage of Trypanosoma rhodesiense.,10.1016/0166-6851(85)90119-7,1985-05-01,[],"Addition of Ca2+ (0.01-1 mM) to a standard Trypanosoma rhodesiense Mg2+-ATPase assay failed to elicit any increase in activity. However, in the absence of externally added Mg2+ and using calcium-EGTA or calcium-CDTA to precisely maintain free metal ion concentration, it was possible to measure a specific Ca2+-ATPase. Cell fractionation studies revealed this ATPase to be predominantly associated with subcellular particles having an equilibrium density of 1.22 g cm-3 and identified as surface membrane. Using a discontinuous sucrose gradient, a surface membrane enriched (SME) fraction, only slightly contaminated with mitochondria as judged by dichlorophenolindophenol-linked alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity, was prepared. The SME fraction exhibited Ca2+-ATPase activity, using 200 nM free Ca2+, of 90 and 21 mU mg-1 protein, respectively, using CDTA and EGTA as buffering ligands. This latter result was most unexpected and indicated that the Ca2+-ATPase, in addition to having no Mg2+ requirement, was inhibited by submicromolar levels of Mg2+. The Ca2+-ATPase was found to have a K0.5 = 128 +/- 22 nM free Ca2+, the response to increasing Ca2+ concentration displaying an extremely high degree of co-operativity (Hill number (nH) = 4.9). The enzyme was found to be highly substrate-specific for ATP with K0.5 = 6.2 +/- 0.61 microM ATP. A Hill plot of the reaction velocity as a function of ATP concentration indicated two substrate binding sites (nH = 1.55). A range of potential modulators of ATPase activity were investigated, with only vanadate (V2O3-8) having any effect: 47% inhibition at 5.0 microM. The Ca2+-ATPase was unaffected by the calmodulin antagonists chlorpromazine (50 microM) and trifluoperazine (50 microM), whilst addition of calmodulin failed to produce any stimulation of activity. It is concluded that the kinetic properties of this ATPase are compatible with a potential role in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ in bloodstream T. rhodesiense."
1870,The intracellular pathway and assembly of newly formed variable surface glycoprotein of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1073/pnas.81.24.7703,1984-12-01,[],"Pulse-chase experiments using L-[35S]methionine suggest that Trypanosoma brucei MITat 1.2 variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, a process that takes 6-8 min, is shuttled to the Golgi complex 8 min later. Labeling of ultrathin frozen sections with affinity-purified anti-cross-reacting determinant (CRD) IgG followed by protein A-colloidal gold shows that the CRD is localized in the trans-Golgi region. cis-Golgi is not labeled. VSG, when solubilized by treatment with the detergent Nonidet P-40, behaves on sucrose density gradients as a non-membrane protein with a sedimentation value of 5 S. In contrast, VSG solubilized in the presence of Zwittergent TM 3-14 yielded several VSG-containing fractions greater than 5 S, and only the 5S fraction contained the CRD. Lack of the CRD in VSG complexes with sedimentation values greater than 5 S suggests that this determinant is either masked from antibody, perhaps by involvement in polymer formation, or represents the membrane form of VSG recently described by Cardoso de Almeida and Turner [Cardoso de Almeida, M. L. & Turner, M. J. (1983) Nature (London) 302, 349-352]."

No metabolism of AIB was detected under conditions leading to a 100-fold accumulation of AIB within the organism. Kinetic studies revealed that AIB uptake involved two components; that operating at low substrate concentrations had an apparent Km of 4.6 mM. Experiments with ionophores such as gramicidin and carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone were consistent with the AIB uptake system operating as a H+-symporter responding to the electrochemical gradient of H+, the major component of which was the membrane potential."
1872,Characterization of spermidine synthase from Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(84)90098-7,1984-09-01,[],"Spermidine synthase from Trypanosoma brucei brucei was characterized and found to be similar to spermidine synthase from other sources. The Km for putrescine was found to be 0.2 mM and the Km for decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine 0.1 microM. The approximate molecular weight of the enzyme was 74 000 as determined by a combination of molecular sieve chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Spermidine synthase activity was markedly inhibited in vitro by dicyclohexylamine (50% inhibition at 3 microM) and cyclohexylamine (50% inhibition at 15 microM); both being competitive inhibitors with respect to putrescine. S-Adenosyl-1,8-diamino-3-thiooctane, a nucleoside bisubstrate analog, was also a potent inhibitor of enzyme activity (50% inhibition at 25 microM). Administration of dicyclohexylamine to mice with trypanosomiasis resulted in no increase in survival time probably due to the lack of effect on trypanosome spermidine concentrations. Other possible inhibitors remain to be tested in vivo."

It was shown that the storage conditions for the organism were critical for the production of reproducible data. Using this method it has been shown that threonine uptake occurs rapidly, being linear for less than 30 s at 37 degrees C in contrast with previous reported results. Kinetic analysis of threonine uptake at 25 degrees C and at physiological plasma threonine levels (20-700 microM) gave a Km of 250 microM and a Vmax of 8 nmol mg-1 cell protein min-1. At these concentrations threonine uptake takes place against a concentration gradient."

We have cannulated the afferent and efferent lymphatics of the draining lymph node in goats and examined the onset of a cellular reaction, the emigration of the parasite from the chancre and the development of both antigenic variation and the specific immune response. The chancre first became detectable by day 3 post-infection, peaked by day 6 and then subsided. Lymphocyte output increased 6- to 8-fold by day 10 and the number of lymphoblasts increased 50-fold in this period. Both then declined. Trypanosomes were detected in lymph 1-2 days before the chancre, peaked by days 5-6, declined during development of the chancre and then peaked again. The bloodstream population appeared by days 4-5 and displayed different kinetics from that in lymph. Recirculation of parasites through the lymphatics ensued. Lymph-borne trypanosome populations were highly pleomorphic. Parasites in lymph expressed firstly a mixture of the Variable Antigen Types (VATs) which are found characteristically in the tsetse fly, this being followed by a mixture of other VATs. The two groups overlapped in appearance. In the bloodstream the same sequence of events occurred although 2 or 3 days later. The specific antibody response, as measured by radioimmunoassay and agglutination, arose within a few days of the first detection of each VAT. Activities appeared first in the lymph and then in plasma."

While Suramin inhibited significantly the activities of cytoplasmic glutamate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase, Berenil had no effect. The kinetic profiles of these enzymes consistently showed a Km value similar to that of controls. Both cytosolic and microsomal glutathione-S transferase and microsomal epoxide hydratase were unaffected by Suramin. However, a significant increase in cytosolic glutathione-S transferase was observed with Berenil. Microsomal phospholipids were not affected by any of the drugs."

Since natural resistance correlates with the rate of differentiation, this observation may provide important information about factors that control the severity of trypanosomiasis."
1879,Trypanocidal action of neuroleptic phenothiazines in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(83)90097-x,1983-11-01,[],"This paper reports the effects of a series of phenothiazine derivatives on trypanosomes in vitro. Our results demonstrate that trypanosomes are very sensitive to some of these compounds at micromolar concentrations. Electron microscopic analysis of drug-treated cells shows that the pellicular layer of microtubules is selectively disintegrated by phenothiazine treatment, while the flagellar axoneme is entirely resistant to the drug. These observations suggest that phenothiazines might constitute a promising candidate group for the development of new trypanocidal drugs. Furthermore, they indicate that the mechanism of drug action is mediated through a specific interaction of phenothiazines with the pellicular, but not with the flagellar, microtubules."
1880,In vivo effects of alpha-DL-difluoromethylornithine on the metabolism and morphology of Trypanosoma brucei brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(83)90022-1,1983-03-01,[],"The EATRO 110 isolate of Trypanosoma brucei brucei was grown in rats for 60 h and the animals treated with the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor alpha-DL-difluoromethylornithine 12 h or 36 h prior to sacrifice. Control untreated animals died 72-80 h after infection. Treated parasites were shorter and broader than the predominantly long slender forms found in untreated controls and many had two or more nuclei and kinetoplasts. Trypanosomes were purified from blood and examined for disruption of polyamine metabolism. ODC activity decreased by more than 99% after 12 h treatment and putrescine and spermidine levels also decreased dramatically. Spermine, not normally present in control cells, increased to detectable, low levels (less than 1 nmol mg-1 protein) after 36 h treatment. alpha-DL-Difluoromethylornithine-treated cells were unable to synthesize putrescine from [3H]ornithine but were able to convert [3H]putrescine + methionine to spermidine. 12-h treated parasites responded to polyamine depletion by assimilating radiolabeled polyamines in vitro at 2- to 4-times the rate of untreated cells. The metabolism of S-adenosylmethionine was also altered in treated parasites: decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine increased more than 1000-fold over untreated cells while S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity, associated with the formation of spermidine and spermine in other eukaryotes, paradoxically declined in treated cells. Synthesis of macromolecules was perturbed in treated parasites: rates of DNA and RNA synthesis declined 50-100%, while protein synthesis increased up to 4-fold in 36-h treated cells. alpha-DL-Difluoromethylornithine treatment progressively limits the parasites' ability to synthesize nucleic acids and blocks cytokinesis while inducing morphological changes resembling long slender leads to short stumpy transformation."

After transfer to the transformation medium at 27 degrees C, VSG synthesis is repressed with a half-time, t1/2 = 30 min. Concomitantly VSG-specific mRNA is lost suggesting that repression operates at the transcriptional level. The expression-linked extra gene copy, which codes for VSG, is retained during and after completion of transformation. After repression of VSG synthesis, surface VSG is shed from the cells into the culture medium. During release part of VSG (apparent mol. wt. 61 000) is proteolytically cleaved to a product (apparent mol. wt. 51 000) which represents the N-terminal domain of the protein as judged by the absence of the carbohydrate moiety normally linked to the C terminus."
1883,Interaction of high-density lipoprotein with Trypanosoma brucei: effect of membrane stabilizers.,10.1002/jcb.240230107,1983-01-01,[],"The specific lysis of bloodstream trypanosomes by serum from a nonpermissive mammalian host is the result of interaction between the serum trypanocidal factor (high-density lipoprotein) and the trypanosome surface. The studies described in this paper attempt to define further the mode of action of this cytotoxic lipoprotein. The binding of high-density lipoprotein to Trypanosoma brucei was instantaneous at 4 degrees C and readily reversible. Binding was not mediated by the surface glycoprotein as removal of the surface coat enhanced binding at 4 degrees C, and no stable glycoprotein-lipoprotein complex could be detected. Pretreatment of trypanosomes with the cross linker dimethylsuberimidate rendered cells resistant to lysis. Addition of membrane-stabilizing drugs, such as cytochalasins C, D, and E, and local anesthetics (dibucaine, tetracaine, and procaine), also inhibited high-density lipoprotein-induced cell lysis. The data presented support the idea that at 37 degrees C lateral diffusion of the variant surface glycoprotein, an integral membrane protein, allows maximal high-density lipoprotein-cell interaction in serum-sensitive cells, and that altered properties of the plasma membrane induced by low temperature or the addition of cytochalasins, local anesthetics, or zinc inhibit this interaction, possibly by increasing the shielding of the plasma membrane by more rigidly anchored surface glycoprotein molecules."

Purine bases are converted directly to ribonucleotides and with the exception of guanine, are stable. Guanine is incorporated directly into ribonucleotides and also deaminated to xanthine. Purine ribonucleosides are hydrolyzed rapidly; these reactions may limit their incorporation since purine bases label the nucleotide pools more efficiently than do ribonucleosides. The apparent order of salvage efficiency for ribonucleosides is adenosine greater than inosine greater than guanosine greater than xanthosine for both organisms. T. b. gambiense salvages purine bases in the same order, while T. b. rhodesiense salvages purine bases in the order hypoxanthine greater than adenine greater than guanine greater than xanthine."

The enzyme required pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, dithiothreitol and EDTA for optimal activity. Several properties of the enzyme were investigated and compared to the mammalian enzyme. Most notably, the parasite enzyme was greater than 60-fold more sensitive to the inhibitor DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine than its mammalian counterpart, thus making it an attractive target for chemotherapy."
1889,Local anaesthetics including benzyl alcohol activate the adenylate cyclase in Trypanosoma brucei by a calcium-dependent mechanism.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1982.tb19778.x,1982-04-01,[],"1. The adenylate cyclase of Trypanosoma brucei is activated by local anaesthetics. 2. Activation of adenylate cyclase by the local anaesthetic, benzyl alcohol, requires Ca2+. 3. The kinetics of the presteady state reveal that the activation step occurs prior to and is separate from the catalytic step. 4. The activation step in the presence of Ca2+ can be stimulated some 200-fold and is highly co-operative with respect to benzyl alcohol concentration. 5. The mechanism by which local anaesthetics activate may be by exposing the Ca2+ -binding site of the Ca2+ receptor which is oriented towards the hydrophobic regions of the plasma membrane in the basal state."
1890,"Effects of exogenous polyamine and trypanocides on the DNA polymerase activities from Trypanosoma brucei brucei, mouse thymus and murine leukemia virus.",10.1016/0166-6851(82)90032-9,1982-04-01,[],"The effects of exogenously added spermine on activated (gapped) DNA-directed and poly(dC) . (dG)12-18-directed DNA synthesis were tested on the chromatographically separated DNA polymerase activities of Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Activated DNA-directed DNA synthesis by the Peak I (eluting from DNA-agarose at 0.15 M KCl) and Peak II (eluting at 0.3 M KCl) polymerase was consistently inhibited or stimulated, respectively, by exogenous spermine. Kinetic analysis revealed that inhibition of the Peak I enzyme with respect to template DNA occurred by a mixed mechanism, while a major factor in the stimulation of the Peak II enzyme by spermine appeared to be the polyamine-mediated reversal of ""substrate inhibition' by DNA at concentrations above 10 micrograms/ml. The apparent Km values of Peak I and Peak II DNA polymerase for activated DNA were determined to be 5 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. In contrast to the results observed with activated DNA, activation of Peak II-enzyme-catalyzed poly(dC)-directed DNA synthesis was similar at all template-primer concentrations. Peak I enzyme-catalyzed poly(dG) synthesis was either inhibited or slightly stimulated by spermine, depending upon the presence or absence of heteropolymeric DNA, respectively. Dose-dependent inhibition of DNA-directed DNA synthesis catalyzed by T. b. brucei DNA polymerases, murine thymus DNA polymerase alpha, and Rauscher murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase by trypanocides was examined to determine a possible mechanism of selective toxicity by such agents. The drugs Antrycide (quinapyramine), pentamidine, imidocarb, Berenil (diminazene aceturate), WR-199-385-[2,5-bis(4-guanylphenyl)furan . 2HCl] and isometamidium inhibited DNA polymerases of the eucaryotic cells at approximately the same degree, and at similar concentrations. The presence of spermine in reaction mixtures did not spare any drug inhibition. Stimulation of reverse transcriptase activity was observed in the presence of Antrycide and imidocarb, however, this could be negated by stimulatory amounts of spermine present in the reaction mixture. The results, obtained using an activated DNA-directed assay system, suggest that trypanosomal DNA polymerases are not the selective target of trypanocidal drugs currently available."
1892,Identification and characterisation of two N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases associated with Trypanosoma Brucei microsomes.,10.1016/0166-6851(82)90019-6,1982-03-01,[],"Microsomes forom Trypanosoma brucei contain glycosyltransferases able to incorporate N-[14C]acetylglucosamine into two different types of acceptors. A first transferase catalyzes the transfer of N-[14C]acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate from uridine diphosphate N-[14C]acetylglucosamine into dolichol monophosphate. The enzymatic activity requires Mn2+, is time and temperature dependent, has an optimum pH of 7.4 and is completely inhibited by the antibiotic tunicamycin. Exogenous dolichol monophosphate enhances the glycosyltransferase activity. The kinetics of incorporation are characterized by a Km of 2.6 microM for uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase are comparable to those reported for the first enzyme of the dolichol cycle described in several eukaryotes. N-Acetyl-glucosaminylpyrophosphoryl-dolichol is essentially the only product of the reaction. A second type of activity which is responsible for the direct transfer of N[14C]acetylglucosamine from uridine diphosphate N[14C]acetylglucosamine into several endogenous polypeptide acceptors, is also associated with T. brucei microsomes. The reaction, which might be due to more than one enzyme, is dependent on Mn2+, but differs from the other transferase in all other characteristics. Time course and optimal temperature are different, and the optimum pH is 6.5. The reaction is independent of the external addition of dolichol monophosphate and tunicamy cin has no inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity. AKm of 1.6 microM was calculated fr uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine."
1897,The kinetoplast of DNA of Trypanosoma gambiense: comparison with the kDNA of Trypanosoma equiperdum.,10.1016/s0300-9084(81)80035-1,1981-10-01,[],"The molecular components of the kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) network of Trypanosoma gambiense have been studied and compared with those of the very closely related species T. equiperdum, previously studied in detail. The kDNA of T. gambiense contains about 80 maxicircles of 20 kilobase pairs and 4000 minicircles of 1 kilobase pairs. The restriction cleavage sites of 7 restriction endonucleases have been mapped on the T. gambiense maxicircle. The majority of these sites were also found in T. equiperdum maxicircles; however their relative positions which are different do not allow us to conclude to relatedness of maps. Maxicircles of the Cairn or of the rolling circle type have been observed and thought to be replicative intermediates. Experiments on renaturation kinetics and hybridization after blotting transfer, show that T. gambiense and T. equiperdum maxicircles have base sequences in common. The T. gambiense minicircles are heterogeneous in base sequence, in contrast to the T. equiperdum minicircles which are homogeneous. The minicircles of the two species have also common base sequences."
1899,The expression-linked copy of a surface antigen gene in Trypanosoma is probably the one transcribed.,10.1038/292265a0,1981-07-16,[],"The antigenic specificity of the living trypanosome seems to be determined by the protein component of a unique glycoprotein species covering the whole surface of the parasite. During chronic infection, a single clone of trypanosomes may successively express a large repertoire of different variable antigen types (VATs). There are probably as many genes as variant-specific antigens (VSAs) (see refs 1-3 for reviews). The expression of the genes coding for the synthesis of these antigens is linked to genomic rearrangements involving duplication of the coding sequence and transposition of the additional copy. The regulation of the expression of the VSA genes is operated at the transcriptional level. It can thus be supposed that their transcription depends on the presence of the additional, transposed copy. We report here that this additional copy is in a chromatin configuration highly sensitive to pancreatic deoxyribonuclease, suggesting that it is the transcribed one."
1900,Characteristics of the calcium-mediated mechanism activating adenylate cyclase in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1981.tb05360.x,1981-06-01,[],"1. The adenylate cyclase of bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei is regulated by Ca2+. 2. The Ca2+-stimulated activity is not inhibited by trifluperazine, tentatively suggesting that the stimulation may not be mediated by calmodulin. 3. The Ca2+-binding site of the receptor regulating the adenylate cyclase is buried within the hydrophobic region of the plasma membrane and is not exposed to either the inner or the outer aqueous-phase bounding the membrane in unstimulated cells. 4. The response of the adenylate cyclase to stimulation by Ca2+ within the membrane is a transient increase in activity followed by a period of 'down regulation'. 5. The 'down regulation' of the adenylate cyclase also occurs by a Ca2+-dependent mechanism."
1901,Analysis of antigenic types appearing in first relapse populations of clones of Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1017/s0031182000041871,1981-02-01,[],"Variant antigenic types (VATs) represented in a total of 47 first relapse populations of 6 clones of Trypanosoma brucei LUMP 227 were identified by immunofluorescent staining of living trypanosomes, using antiserum raised against purified surface antigens. The relative growth rates of these 6 clones were measured both individually and when grown together in a mixed population, and were found to be different under these two sets of conditions. A pattern emerged in the VATs represented in relapses of each clone, with some types being expressed more frequently than others and certain VATs being only very rarely expressed. It is suggested that new VATs are expressed according to a statistically definable order of priority which is different for each parent VAT, and that some VATs may be able to change to certain others only after passing through an intermediate VAT. The order of priority of appearance of VATs does not appear to correlate with growth rate measured either in individual clones or when clones are grown in a mixed population."
1905,Uptake of purine bases and nucleosides in African trypanosomes.,10.1017/s0031182000056110,1980-10-01,[],"Uptake of radioactivity labelled purine bases and nucleosides by suspensions of Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma congolense in bicine buffer was determined at 37 degrees C. With T. brucei, the rate of uptake of adenosine was much greater than that of the other compounds tested, the uptake of which decreased in the order adenine, inosine, guanosine and hypoxanthine. With T. brucei, adenosine uptake increased with concentration in a manner suggesting two mechanisms, one with high and the other with low affinity for adenosine. The uptake of adenine increased with concentration only up to about 1.5 microM while the uptake of guanosine increased little with concentration and that of inosine and hypoxanthine not at all. In both species adenosine strongly inhibited the uptake of both of the other nucleosides and of both purine bases. In T. brucei, guanosine and inosine caused small increases in adenosine uptake which was, however, inhibited by them in T. congolense. In T. brucei, each of the purine bases adenine and hypoxanthine inhibited its own uptake maximally but that of each other less effectively. Hypoxanthine was more effective than adenine in inhibiting the uptake of the nucleosides guanosine and inosine, but neither base effected marked inhibition of adenosine uptake. The uptake of adenosine by T. brucei was inhibited by dipyridamole and its analogue, compound RA--233, strongly at 100 microM and slightly at 10 microM. The other dipyridamole analogues, VK--744 and VK--774, were ineffective."

Glycosyltransferase activity incorporating N-[14C]acetylglucosamine ([14C]GlcNAc) from uridine diphosphate N-[14C]acetylglucosamine (UDP-[14C]GlcNAc) into endogenous proitein acceptors was localized primarily in the plasma membrane of Trypanosoma brucei. 2. The acceptor site for the nucleotide sugar was further localized exclusively to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. 3. The glycosyltransferase produced elongation of the growing oligosaccharide chains while they were attached to their peptide acceptors. 4. This glycosyltransferase activity was incapable of initiating sugar attachment directly to amino acid residues within peptide acceptors. 5. The dolichyl-phosphate-sugar pathway for glycoprotein biosynthesis was either absent of only present at a very low level in T. brucei when compared to rat liver. 6. All oligosaccharide chains accepting GlcNAc were of the same or very similar lengths. 7. Both O-glycosidic (26%) and N-glycosidic (74%) linkages (exclusive of hydroxylysine attachment) were found. 8. Glycosyltransferase activity required either Mn2+ or Mg2+, had a pH optimum of 6.5 and was temperature-dependent. 9. The kinetics of incorporation were complex, probably a result of multiple acceptors or glycosyltransferases whose activities were characterized by a Km of 30 microM for UDP-GlcNAc with a V of 40 pmol x mg protein -1 x min-1 for the highest affinity system and a Km of approximately 2 mM for UDP-GlcNAc with a V of approximately 400 pmol x mg protein-1 x min-1 for the lowest affinity system. 10. Glycosyltransferases using UDP-GlcNAc, uridine diphosphate glucose, uridine diphosphate galactose and guanidine diphosphate mannose as glycosyl donors were observed. Each peptide acceptor was specific for a singloe labelled sugar in the absence of other unlabelled nucleotide sugars. 11. The final extent of incorporation of GlcNAc was due primarily to exhaustion of peptide acceptor. 12. An inhibitor of UDP-[14C]GlcNAc incorporation into plasma membranes was found in the cytoplasmic fraction."
1908,Fatty acid uptake by bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei and other species of the kinetoplastida.,10.1016/0166-6851(80)90016-x,1980-06-01,[],"1. Trypanosoma brucei and other species of the Kinetoplastida readily take up fatty acids from a simple incubation medium. This suggests that they at least partially satisfy their nutritional requirements for fatty acids from an exogenous source. 2. Uptake of fatty acids in T. brucei follows a biphasic time course, consisting of an initial rapid phase, thought to represent surface binding, followed by a slower accumulation phase. 3. Culture forms of T. brucei take up more than 10 times as much fatty acid during the rapid initial phase than do bloodstream forms, suggesting the presence of a greater number of fatty acid binding sites in the plasma membranes of the culture forms when compared to the bllodstream forms. 4. The uptake process is reversible. Measurements of the release of a preloaded fatty acid from bloodstream forms of T. brucei, in the presence and in the absence of albumin, provides some support for the hypothesis that fatty acid uptake and release is mediated by a direct interaction of free albumin and fatty acid-albumin complex with the cell surface."
1911,Evidence for a branched electron transport chain in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/0166-6851(80)90038-9,1980-03-01,[],"The flow of electrons the terminal oxidases present in the bloodstream and procyclic trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma brucei LUMP 1026 has been investigated by the use of salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) and cyanide. Respiration in bloodstream trypomastigotes was completely inhibited by 0.5 mM SHAM with a Ki below 10 microM. The Ki for SHAM in procyclic trypomastigotes was 70 microM. In procyclic trypomastigotes there are at least three terminal oxidases of which the two major ones are cytochrome aa3 oxidase, sensitive to cyanide inhibition, and alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase (GPO), sensitive to SHAM inhibition. These two oxidases contribute 60 and 30%, respectively, to total cell respiration. Inhibition of the cytochrome system with cyanide causes an increase in the flow of electrons through the GPO system, and inhibition of the GPO system with SHAM stimulates electron flow in the cytochrome system. Succinate oxidation in the mitochondrial fraction is partially inhibited by SHAM and this SHAM-sensitive respiration is not inhibited by antimycin A. The kinetic data of respiration by procyclic trypomastigotes fit a model proposed by Bahr and Bonner to determine the maximum rates of two competing electron transport pathways. It is concluded that the electron transport chain in T. brucei is branched."
1916,Conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate in parasitic protozoa.,10.1016/0304-4165(79)90131-4,1979-02-01,[],"The conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate, one of the key reactions in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, has been studied in a number of parasitic protozoa. Enzyme activities capable of carrying out this reaction were detected in six members of the Kinetoplastida (Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma vivax, Trypanosoma lewisi, Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania enriettii) and three members of the genus Plasmodium (P. knowlesi, P. berghei, P. gallinaceum). The mechanism of the reaction in the two groups of protozoa were quite distinct. In the Kinetoplastida, the enzyme is an hydroxylase which occurs in the soluble fraction of the cell and probably requires tetrahydrobiopterin for activity. In contrast, in Plasmodium, the enzyme is a dehydrogenase which is particulate, probably mitochondrial, and intimately connected to the electron transport chain to which it passes electrons directly, probably at the ubiquinone level. Neither activity is regulated by fully formed pyrimidines. The enzyme in Plasmodium is similar in mechanism to the isofunctional mammalian enzyme. However, since malarial ubiquinones are apparently different from those in the mammal and since menoctone, which is active in vivo in experimental malaria, is a good inhibitor of the malarial enzyme, it could represent a useful target for chemotherapeutic attack. The enzyme in the Kinetoplastida is quite distinct from that in the mammal so that it too apparently falls into this category, though none of the currently used antitrypanosomal drugs appears to block it activity at physiological concentrations."
1918,Adenylate cyclase in bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) brucei sp.,10.1042/bj1750207,1978-10-01,[],"1. The adenylate cyclase in Trypanosoma brucei is located in the plasma membrane. 2. A partial kinetic analysis of the properties of the enzyme revealed a Km for ATP of 1.75 mM and a Km for Mg2+ of 4mM. 3. At low concentrations, Mg2+ activated the enzyme directly in addition to its effect of lowering the concentration of inhibitory free ATP species. 4. At high concentrations, Mg2+ inhibited the enzyme. Furthermore, the enzyme was inhibited at any Mg2+ concentration if the concentration of ATP exceeded that of Mg2+. 5. The opposing effects of Mg2+ at low and high concentrations would be consistent with more than one binding site for Mg2+ on the enzyme. 6. A study of the patterns of product inhibition revealed little or no effect of 3':5'-cyclic AMP, but a profound inhibition by pyrophosphate, which was competitive with respect to ATP (Ki 0.135 mM). This result suggests that the substrate-binding domain on T. brucei adenylate cyclase interacts mainly with the triphosphate portion of the ATP molecule. 7. The enzyme activity was unaffected by the usual mammalian enzyme effectors glucagon, adrenaline, adenosine, GTP and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. 8. The enzyme was not activated by fluoride, instead a powerful inhibition was found. The enzyme was also inhibited by relatively high concentrations of Ca2+ (1 mM)."

The cyclic AMP receptors were separated by gel chromatography on the basis of their molecular weights. The binding constants of the high and the low molecular weight receptors for cyclic AMP were determined to be 0.4 muM and 0.6 muM, respectively. Cyclic IMP and cyclic GMP compete with cyclic AMP for the binding sites of both receptors. The cyclic AMP binding of the low molecular weight receptor was competitively inhibitied by adenine derivatives. The binding capacity of the high molecular weight receptor was enhanced about two-fold by proteolytic modification with trypsin."
1921,Multiple protein kinases from Trypanosoma gambiense.,10.1515/bchm.1978.359.1.601,1978-05-01,[],"Three protein kinases were distinguished in Trypanosoma gambiense extract. The enzymes preferred phosvitin, histone, and protamine as acceptor proteins, respectively. The amino acid residues of the acceptor proteins which were phosphorylated by these protein-kinase activities were serine and- to less extent- threonine. The protein kinase activities were neither affected by cyclic nucleotides nor by cyclic AMP receptors. The molecular weights of these protein kinases were determined to be greater than 200,000, 95000 and 37000, respectively. The activities of all three protein kinases were affected to varying degrees by nucleotides and nucleosides."
1924,Changes in the kinetic behaviour of threonine transport into Trypanosoma brucei elicited by variation in hydrogen ion concentration.,10.1042/bj1640015,1977-04-15,[],"1. The dependence of V and V/K(m) for threonine transport into Trypanosoma brucei upon the external concentration of H(+) was studied. 2. Two ionizing groups, the alpha-amino group of the substrate and a group at the substrate-binding site of the carrier, were found to influence the observed kinetic behaviour of transport. 3. The pK of the group at the substrate-binding site on the free carrier was found to be 6.95 at 30 degrees C and to be temperature-dependent; its heat of ionization was -63.8kJ, which is outside the range for most proton dissociations and suggests a significant contribution from some other source, possibly the remainder of the carrier or the membrane environment. 4. Binding of substrate caused the pK of its alpha-amino group to shift to a higher value, whereas that of the carrier group shifted to a lower value (6.65 at 30 degrees C). 5. The ionic interaction between substrate and carrier appeared to be involved in the stabilizing of the protonated substrate and the species of the carrier-substrate complex required for the membrane-translocation step. 6. The same ionic species of carrier-substrate complex is required for both substrate dissociation and translocation of the substrate through the membrane. 7. H(+) symport or antiport did not occur during threonine uptake."
1925,Presence and properties of thymidylate synthase in trypanosomatids.,10.1016/0005-2744(77)90138-3,1977-03-15,[],"High speed centrifugal supernatant fractions of homogenates of a number of trypanosomatids were assayed for thymidylate synthase (5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate: dUMP C-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.45) activity using the method of Lomax and Greenberg (1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 109-113). Similar activities were detected in Crithidia fasciculata, Crithidia oncopelti, the blood forms of Trypanosoma brucei, Trypansoma congolense and Trypanosoma lewisi and the blood, intracellular and culture forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, suggesting that all species synthesize at least some thymidylate de novo. The properties of the activities in C. fasciculata and the three forms of T. cruzi were compared with those of the isofunctional bacterial and mammalian enzymes. The trypanosotamid enzyme was inhibited by Mg2+, was much more sensitive to mercaptoethanol, had higher apparent Km values for substrate (dUMP) and cofactor (tetrahydrofolate), had a higher apparent molecular weight and was markedly more sensitive to inhibition by suramin. It is, therefore a possible target for chemotherapeutic attack, either on its own or in combination with a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor. No evidence was obtained for the regulation of the trypanosomatid enzyme, either by its product, dTMP, or by dTDP or dTTp. This result agrees with previous studies which suggested that in trypanosomatids, the level of dTMP was regulated, at least in part, by a catabolic pathway consisting of a thymidylate phosphatase and a thymidine phosphorylase which degraded the excess of dTMP to thymine."
1927,Inhibition of protein kinase activity from Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma gambiense by 3'-deoxyadenosine.,10.1515/bchm2.1977.358.1.23,1977-01-01,[],"3'-Deoxydadenosine was found to be a potent inhibitor of nucleoside-stimulated protein kinase activity from culture forms of Trypanosoma cruzi and bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma gambiense. The type of inhibition by 3'-deoxyadenosine was competitive with respect to ATP. The inhibition constants for 3'-deoxyadenosine were determined to be 0.11mM and 0.085mM for the enzyme from T. cruzi and T. gambiense, respectively. The apparent Km value for ATP was 0.2mM for both enzymes. 2'-Deoxyadenosine was less effective as inhibitor of the protein kinase activity. The inhibition constants were calculated to be 0.8mM and 0.67mM, respectively."

This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of histone and protamine. Various nucleosides at the concentration of 10(-4) M stimulated the histone kinase activity about two-fold, whereas cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP were without effect. The pH-optimum for histone phosphorylation was at about pH 7.0. The enzyme activity absolutely depends on Mg2+, Mn2+ or Co2+. The apparent Km-value for histone was 0.3 mg/ml and those for ATP were 2 - 10(-4) M and 6 - 10(-5) M in the absence or presence of 10(-4) M adenosine respectively. IDP and ADP complete with ATP.

Glycine chloromethyl inhibited the active-transport of L-serine into bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei. 2. Substrates of the short-chain, neutral amino acid transport system (N1), but not of other amino acid transport systems, protected the carrier protein from inhibition. 3. Inhibition was never more than 80% complete. The residual activity might have due to a proportion of N1 carrier active sites which had not reacted with the inhibitor. 4. The inhibition was highly selective for the N1 amino acid transport system. Other amino acid transport systems were not affected and the rate of respiration was only slightly affected. 5. The inhibition was first-order with respect to concentration, indicating that one molecule of the inhibitor reacted with each carrier active-site. 6. The high selectivity of this inhibitor should make it a useful labelling agent during the isolation and purification of the N1 amino acid transport carrier protein(s)."

NADPH is essential for parasite growth and viability. In trypanosomatid parasites, NADPH is supplied by the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway and by enzymes associated with the citric acid cycle. The present article will review recent achievements that suggest glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and the cytosolic isoform of the malic enzyme as promising drug targets for the discovery of new drugs against Trypanosoma cruzi and T. brucei. Topics involving an alternative strategy in accelerating T. cruzi drug-target validation and the concept of drug-target classification will also be revisited."

The high impact of these diseases on human health and economy worldwide, the unsatisfactory available chemotherapeutic options and the absence of human effective vaccines, strongly justifies the search for new drugs. The pentose phosphate pathway has been proposed to be a viable strategy to defeat several infectious diseases, including those from trypanosomatids, as it includes an oxidative branch, important in the maintenance of cell redox homeostasis, and a non-oxidative branch in which ribose 5-phosphate and erythrose 4-phosphate, precursors of nucleic acids and aromatic amino acids, are produced. This review provides an overview of the available chemotherapeutic options against these diseases and discusses the potential of genetically validated enzymes from the pentose phosphate pathway of trypanosomatids to be explored as potential drug targets."
1948,Disclosing the essentiality of ribose-5-phosphate isomerase B in Trypanosomatids.,10.1038/srep26937,2016-05-28,[],"Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPI) belongs to the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, catalysing the inter-conversion of D-ribose-5-phosphate and D-ribulose-5-phosphate. Trypanosomatids encode a type B RPI, whereas humans have a structurally unrelated type A, making RPIB worthy of exploration as a potential drug target. Null mutant generation in Leishmania infantum was only possible when an episomal copy of RPIB gene was provided, and the latter was retained both in vitro and in vivo in the absence of drug pressure. This suggests the gene is essential for parasite survival. Importantly, the inability to remove the second allele of RPIB gene in sKO mutants complemented with an episomal copy of RPIB carrying a mutation that abolishes isomerase activity suggests the essentiality is due to its metabolic function. In vitro, sKO promastigotes exhibited no defect in growth, metacyclogenesis or macrophage infection, however, an impairment in intracellular amastigotes' replication was observed. Additionally, mice infected with sKO mutants rescued by RPIB complementation had a reduced parasite burden in the liver. Likewise, Trypanosoma brucei is resistant to complete RPIB gene removal and mice infected with sKO mutants showed prolonged survival upon infection. Taken together our results genetically validate RPIB as a potential drug target in trypanosomatids."
1949,The Pentose Phosphate Pathway in Parasitic Trypanosomatids.,10.1016/j.pt.2016.04.010,2016-05-14,[],"Parasitic trypanosomatids cause important diseases. Dissecting the biochemistry of these organisms offers a means of discovering targets against which inhibitors may be designed and developed as drugs. The pentose phosphate pathway is a key route of glucose metabolism in most organisms, providing NADPH for use as a cellular reductant and various carbohydrate intermediates used in cellular metabolism. The pathway and its enzymes have been studied in Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and various Leishmania species. Its functions in these parasites are becoming clear. Some enzymes of the pathway are essential to the parasites and have structural features distinguishing them from their mammalian counterparts, and this has stimulated several programs of inhibitor discovery with a view to targeting the pathway with new drugs."
1952,Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase B knockdown compromises Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream form infectivity.,10.1371/journal.pntd.0003430,2015-01-09,[],"Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase is an enzyme involved in the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, and catalyzes the inter-conversion of D-ribose 5-phosphate and D-ribulose 5-phosphate. Trypanosomatids, including the agent of African sleeping sickness namely Trypanosoma brucei, have a type B ribose-5-phosphate isomerase. This enzyme is absent from humans, which have a structurally unrelated ribose 5-phosphate isomerase type A, and therefore has been proposed as an attractive drug target waiting further characterization. In this study, Trypanosoma brucei ribose 5-phosphate isomerase B showed in vitro isomerase activity. RNAi against this enzyme reduced parasites' in vitro growth, and more importantly, bloodstream forms infectivity. Mice infected with induced RNAi clones exhibited lower parasitaemia and a prolonged survival compared to control mice. Phenotypic reversion was achieved by complementing induced RNAi clones with an ectopic copy of Trypanosoma cruzi gene. Our results present the first functional characterization of Trypanosoma brucei ribose 5-phosphate isomerase B, and show the relevance of an enzyme belonging to the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway in the context of Trypanosoma brucei infection."

It also has the function of depleting 6PG, whose accumulation induces cell senescence. 6PGDH is a proposed drug target for African trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei and for other microbial infections and cancer. Gel filtration, density gradient sedimentation, cross-linking and dynamic light scattering were used to assay the oligomerization state of T. brucei 6PGDH in the absence and presence of several ligands. The enzyme displays a dimer-tetramer equilibrium and NADPH (but not NADP) reduces the rate of approach to equilibrium, while 6PG is able to antagonize the NADPH effect. The different behaviour of the two forms of coenzyme appears to be related to the differences in ΔCp, with NADP binding ΔCp closer to what is expected of crystallographic structures, while NADPH ΔCp is three times larger. The estimated dimer-tetramer association constant is 1.5·10(6)M(-1), and the specific activity of the tetramer is about 3 fold higher than the specific activity of the dimer. Thus, cellular conditions promoting tetramer formation could allow an efficient clearing of 6PG. Experiments carried out on sheep liver 6PGDH indicate that tetramerization is a specificity of the parasite enzyme."

However, this compound does not have trypanocidal activity due to its poor membrane permeability. Consequently, we have previously reported a prodrug approach to improve the antiparasitic activity of this inhibitor by converting the phosphate group into a less charged phosphate prodrug. The activity of prodrugs appeared to be dependent on their stability in phosphate buffer. Here we have successfully further extended the development of the aryl phosphoramidate prodrugs of 2,3-O-isopropylidene-4-erythrono hydroxamate by synthesizing a small library of phosphoramidates and evaluating their biological activity and stability in a variety of assays. Some of the compounds showed high trypanocidal activity and good correlation of activity with their stability in fresh mouse blood."

Current work for the development of new drugs against this pathology includes evaluation of enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which first requires a clear understanding of their function and mechanism of action. In this context, we focused on T. brucei 6-phosphogluconolactonase (Tb6PGL), which converts delta-6-phosphogluconolactone into 6-phosphogluconic acid in the second step of the PPP. We have determined the crystal structure of Tb6PGL in complex with two ligands, 6-phosphogluconic acid and citrate, at 2.2 A and 2.0 A resolution, respectively. We have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on Tb6PGL in its empty form and in complex with delta-6-phosphogluconolactone, its natural ligand. Analysis of the structural data and MD simulations allowed us to propose a detailed enzymatic mechanism for 6PGL enzymes."

G6PDH catalyzes the first step of the pentose-phosphate pathway supplying cells with ribose 5-phosphate, a precursor of nucleic acid synthesis, and NADPH for biosynthetic processes and protection against oxidative stress. In this paper we demonstrate that also G6PDH of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is uncompetitively inhibited by DHEA and epiandrosterone (EA), with K(i) values in the lower micromolar range. A viability assay confirmed the toxic effect of both steroids on cultured T. brucei bloodstream form cells. Additionally, RNAi mediated reduction of the G6PDH level in T. brucei bloodstream forms validated this enzyme as a drug target against Human African Trypanosomiasis. Together these findings show that inhibition of G6PDH by DHEA derivatives may lead to the development of a new class of anti-trypanosomatid compounds."

These inhibitors were charged phosphate derivatives with restricted capacity to enter cells. Herein, we report the synthesis of five different classes of prodrugs: phosphoramidate; bis-S-acyl thioethyl esters (bis-SATE); bis-pivaloxymethyl (bis-POM); CycloSaligenyl; and phenyl, S-acyl thioethyl mixed phosphate esters (mix-SATE). Prodrugs were studied for stability and activity against the intact parasites. Most prodrugs caused inhibition of the growth of the parasites. The activity of the prodrugs against the parasites appeared to be related to their stability in aqueous buffer."
1962,Three dimensional structure and implications for the catalytic mechanism of 6-phosphogluconolactonase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1016/j.jmb.2006.11.063,2007-01-02,[],"Enzymes from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) are potential drug targets for the development of new drugs against Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping disease: for instance, the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is currently studied actively for such purposes. Structural and functional studies are necessary to better characterize the associated enzymes and compare them to their human homologues, in order to undertake structure-based drug design studies on such targets. In this context, the crystal structure of 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL) from T. brucei, the second enzyme from PPP, was determined at 2.1 Angstroms resolution. Comparison of its sequence and structure to other related proteins in the 6PGL family with a known structure (Thermotoga maritima Tm6GPL 1PBT and Vibrio cholerae Vc6PGL (1Y89), which have not been discussed in print), or in the glucosamine-6-phosphate-deaminase family (hexameric Escherichia coli 1DEA and monomeric Bacillus subtilis 2BKV), allowed the identification of the 6PGL active site. In addition to the analysis of the crystal structure, 3D NMR interaction studies and docking experiments are reported here. Key residues involved in substrate binding or in catalysis were identified."

The third enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, has been shown to be a good target for drugs. The enzyme is essential to the trypanosomes that causes sleeping sickness and structural differences when compared to its mammalian counterpart allow for selective inhibition. Three series of inhibitors have been designed, these include phosphorylated carbohydrate substrate and transition state analogues, non-carbohydrate substrate analogues and also triphenylmethane-based compounds. All have shown selective inhibition of the trypanosomal 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and representatives of each have trypanocidal activity."
1969,Purification and cloning of chloroplast 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from spinach. Cyanobacterial genes for chloroplast and cytosolic isoenzymes encoded in eukaryotic chromosomes.,10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02154.x,2001-04-27,[],"Previous attempts to purify chloroplast 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (cp6PGDH), a key enzyme of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, have been unsuccessful due to rapid activity loss. An efficient purification protocol was developed and the enzyme from spinach leaves was purified 1000-fold to apparent homogeneity with a specific activity of 60 U.mg-1. The enzyme is a homodimer with subunits of 50 kDa. Antibodies raised against the purified cp6PGDH detected a 53-kDa protein from a crude extract, indicating alterations during purification. Purified cp6PGDH was microsequenced and the corresponding spinach cDNA was cloned using PCR techniques and degenerate primers. The cDNA for cytosolic 6PGDH from spinach was cloned for comparison. Phylogenetic analysis in the context of available homologues from eukaryotes and eubacteria revealed that animal and fungal cytosolic 6PGDH sequences are more similar to their homologues from gamma-proteobacteria, whereas plant 6PGDH is more similar to its cyanobacterial homologues. The ancestral gene for higher plant 6PGDH was acquired from the antecedent of plastids through endosymbiosis and gene transfer to the nucleus. A subsequent gene duplication gave rise to higher plant cytosolic 6PGDH, which assumed the function of its pre-existing cytosolic homologue through endosymbiotic gene replacement. The protein phylogeny of both 6PGDH and of the first enzyme of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, indicate a surprisingly close relationship between the plant and Trypanosoma brucei lineages, suggesting that T. brucei (a relative of Euglena gracilis) may be secondarily nonphotosynthetic."
1973,A 2.8 A resolution structure of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei: comparison with the sheep enzyme accounts for differences in activity with coenzyme and substrate analogues.,10.1006/jmbi.1998.2059,1998-09-17,[],"The three-dimensional structure of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) from the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei has been solved at 2.8 A resolution. This pentose phosphate pathway enzyme is NADP-dependent; NADPH generated in the reaction protects against oxidative stress. The enzyme crystallises in the space-group P3121 with a dimer in the asymmetric unit and cell dimensions a=b=135.13 A, c=116.74 A, alpha=beta=90 degrees, gamma=120 degrees. The structure has refined to R=18.6% (Rfree=27.3%) with good geometry. The amino acid sequence of T. brucei 6PGDH is only 35% identical to that of the sheep liver enzyme and significant activity differences have been observed. The active dimer assembles with the C-terminal tail of one subunit threaded through the other, forming part of the substrate binding site. The tail of T. brucei 6PGDH is shorter than that of the sheep enzyme and its terminal residues associate tightly with the second monomer. The three-dimensional structure shows this generates additional interactions between the subunits close to the active site; the coenzyme binding domain is thereby associated more tightly with the helical domain. Three residues, conserved in all other known sequences, are important in creating a salt bridge between monomers close to the substrate binding site. The differences could explain the 200-fold enhanced affinity observed for the substrate analogue 6-phospho-2-deoxy-D-gluconate and suggest targets for anti-parasite drug design. The coenzyme binding domain of 6PGDH has a beta-alpha-beta fold; while in most species the ""fingerprint"" sequence is GxAxxG, in the T. brucei enzyme it is GxGxxG. Additional interactions between the enzyme and the coenzyme bis-phosphate are likely in the parasite 6PGDH, accounting for greater inhibition (40-fold) of 2'5'-ADP. While the core of the T. brucei dimer was restrained during refinement, several conformational differences have been found between the monomers; those at the coenzyme binding site suggest the molecule could be asymmetric during the enzyme reaction."
1974,Preliminary crystallographic study of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1006/jmbi.1993.1510,1993-09-20,[],"We have obtained well-ordered single crystals of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, from Trypanosoma brucei. The crystals are trigonal rhombs with unit cell dimensions a = b = 135.1 A, c = 116.7 A and belong to one of the enantiomorphic pair of space groups P3(1)21/P3(2)21. X-ray diffraction to better than 2.8 A has been recorded using a rotating anode CuK alpha source. Elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the T. brucei enzyme will, by indicating structural differences from the known sheep enzyme structure, aid the design of mutants to probe the active site. Knowledge of the structure will also assist in assessing the potential use of rationally designed compounds to inhibit this enzyme specifically."
1989,A alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase is present in Trypanosoma cruzi glycosomes.,10.1590/s0074-02762001000500021,2001-08-14,[],"alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GPDH-EC.1.1.1.8) has been considered absent in Trypanosoma cruzi in contradiction with all other studied trypanosomatids. After observing that the sole malate dehydrogenase can not maintain the intraglycosomal redox balance, GPDH activity was looked for and found, although in very variable levels, in epimastigotes extracts. GPDH was shown to be exclusively located in the glycosome of T. cruzi by digitonin treatment and isopycnic centrifugation. Antibody against T. brucei GPDH showed that this enzyme seemed to be present in an essentially inactive form at the beginning of the epimastigotes growth. GPDH is apparently linked to a salicylhydroxmic-sensitive glycerophosphate reoxidizing system and plays an essential role in the glycosome redox balance."

2099,The flagellar adenylate kinases of Trypanosoma cruzi.,10.1093/femsle/fnu020,2015-03-20,"['Chagas’ disease', 'Trypanosoma brucei', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'adenylate kinase', 'flagellum', 'phosphotransferase']","Adenylate kinases (ADK) are key enzymes involved in cell energy management. Trypanosomatids present the highest number of variants in a single cell in comparison with the rest of the living organisms. In this work, we characterized two flagellar ADKs from Trypanosoma cruzi, called TcADK1 and TcADK4, which are also located in the cell cytosol. Interestingly, TcADK1 presents a stage-specific expression. This variant was detected in epimastigotes cells, and was completely absent in trypomastigotes and amastigotes, while TcADK4 is present in the major life cycle stages of T. cruzi. Both variants are also regulated, in opposite ways, along the parasite growth curve suggesting that their expression depends on the intra- and extracellular conditions. Both, TcADK1 and TcADK4 present N-terminal extension that could be responsible for their subcellular localization. The presence of ADK variants in the flagellum would be critical for the provision of energy in a process of high ATP consumption such as cell motility."
2100,Adenylate cyclases of Trypanosoma brucei inhibit the innate immune response of the host.,10.1126/science.1222753,2012-06-16,[],"The parasite Trypanosoma brucei possesses a large family of transmembrane receptor-like adenylate cyclases. Activation of these enzymes requires the dimerization of the catalytic domain and typically occurs under stress. Using a dominant-negative strategy, we found that reducing adenylate cyclase activity by about 50% allowed trypanosome growth but reduced the parasite's ability to control the early innate immune defense of the host. Specifically, activation of trypanosome adenylate cyclase resulting from parasite phagocytosis by liver myeloid cells inhibited the synthesis of the trypanosome-controlling cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α through activation of protein kinase A in these cells. Thus, adenylate cyclase activity of lyzed trypanosomes favors early host colonization by live parasites. The role of adenylate cyclases at the host-parasite interface could explain the expansion and polymorphism of this gene family."
2101,Singular features of trypanosomatids' phosphotransferases involved in cell energy management.,10.4061/2011/576483,2011-05-24,[],"Trypanosomatids are responsible for economically important veterinary affections and severe human diseases. In Africa, Trypanosoma brucei causes sleeping sickness or African trypanosomiasis, while in America, Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease. These parasites have complex life cycles which involve a wide variety of environments with very different compositions, physicochemical properties, and availability of metabolites. As the environment changes there is a need to maintain the nucleoside homeostasis, requiring a quick and regulated response. Most of the enzymes required for energy management are phosphotransferases. These enzymes present a nitrogenous group or a phosphate as acceptors, and the most clear examples are arginine kinase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, and adenylate kinase. Trypanosoma and Leishmania have the largest number of phosphotransferase isoforms ever found in a single cell; some of them are absent in mammals, suggesting that these enzymes are required in many cellular compartments associated to different biological processes. The presence of such number of phosphotransferases support the hypothesis of the existence of an intracellular enzymatic phosphotransfer network that communicates the spatially separated intracellular ATP consumption and production processes. All these unique features make phosphotransferases a promising start point for rational drug design for the treatment of human trypanosomiasis."
2102,Intracellular positioning of isoforms explains an unusually large adenylate kinase gene family in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.M413821200,2005-01-20,[],"Adenylate kinases occur classically as cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes, but the expression of seven adenylate kinases in the flagellated protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei (order, Kinetoplastida; family, Trypanosomatidae) easily exceeds the number of isoforms previously observed within a single cell and raises questions as to their location and function. We show that a requirement to target adenylate kinase into glycosomes, which are unique kinetoplastid-specific microbodies of the peroxisome class in which many reactions of carbohydrate metabolism are compartmentalized, and two different flagellar structures as well as cytoplasm and mitochondrion explains the expansion of this gene family in trypanosomes. The three isoforms that are selectively built into either the flagellar axoneme or the extra-axonemal paraflagellar rod, which is essential for motility, all contain long N-terminal extensions. Biochemical analysis of the only short form trypanosome adenylate kinase revealed that this enzyme catalyzes phosphotransfer of gamma-phosphate from ATP to AMP, CMP, and UMP acceptors; its high activity and specificity toward CMP is likely to reflect an adaptation to very low intracellular cytidine nucleotide pools. Analysis of some of the phosphotransfer network using RNA interference suggests considerable complexity within the homeostasis of cellular energetics. The anchoring of specific adenylate kinases within two distinct flagellar structures provides a paradigm for metabolic organization and efficiency in other flagellates."
2103,"Protein targeting of an unusual, evolutionarily conserved adenylate kinase to a eukaryotic flagellum.",10.1091/mbc.e04-03-0217,2004-05-18,[],"The eukaryotic flagellum is a large structure into which specific constituent proteins must be targeted, transported and assembled after their synthesis in the cytoplasm. Using Trypanosoma brucei and a proteomic approach, we have identified and characterized a novel set of adenylate kinase proteins that are localized to the flagellum. These proteins represent unique isoforms that are targeted to the flagellum by an N-terminal extension to the protein and are incorporated into an extraaxonemal structure (the paraflagellar rod). We show that the N-terminal extension is both necessary for isoform location in the flagellum and sufficient for targeting of a green fluorescent protein reporter protein to the flagellum. Moreover, these N-terminal extension sequences are conserved in evolution and we find that they allow the identification of novel adenylate kinases in the genomes of humans and worms. Given the existence of specific isoforms of certain central metabolic enzymes, and targeting sequences for these isoforms, we suggest that these isoforms form part of a complex, ""solid-phase"" metabolic capability that is built into the eukaryotic flagellum."
2104,Simultaneous but independent activation of adenylate cyclase and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C under stress conditions in Trypanosoma brucei.,10.1074/jbc.271.18.10844,1996-05-03,[],"Previous observations suggested a concomitant relationship between the release of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) and the activation of adenylate cyclase in the bloodstream form of the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, adenylate cyclase activity was measured in live trypanosomes subjected to different treatments known to induce the shedding of the VSG coat, namely low pH and trypsin digestion. In both cases adenylate cyclase activation occurred in parallel with the release of the VSG. The latter was found to be mediated by the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C that cleaves the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor of the protein (VSG lipase). Furthermore, both adenylate cyclase and VSG release were activated by the incubation of trypanosomes with specific inhibitors of protein kinase C, suggesting a repressive role for protein kinase C on both VSG lipase and adenylate cyclase activities. Significantly, in mutant trypanosomes lacking VSG lipase, adenylate cyclase was activated under conditions where VSG release did not occur. Moreover,VSG release was also found to occur in the absence of activation of the cyclase, as observed in the presence of low concentration of the thiol modifying reagent p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid. These observations provide the first demonstration that release of the VSG in response to cellular stress is mediated by the VSG lipase and that while both release of the VSG and activation of adenylate cyclase occur in response to the same stimuli they are not obligatorily coupled."
2107,"Subcellular distribution of adenylate cyclase, cyclic-AMP phosphodiesterase, protein kinases and phosphoprotein phosphatase in Trypanosoma brucei.",10.1016/0166-6851(82)90061-5,1982-11-01,[],"The subcellular distribution of adenylate cyclase, cyclic-AMP phosphodiesterase, protein kinases and phosphoprotein phosphatase in bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei was determined by isopycnic sucrose-gradient centrifugation of post-large-granule extracts. Cyclic-AMP phosphodiesterase was almost entirely soluble whereas adenylate cyclase was membrane-bound. The latter enzyme appeared to be absent from the plasma-membrane fraction but copurified with acid phosphatase and acid phosphodiesterase indicating a possible association with the flagellar pocket. At least two protein kinase activities could be distinguished as based on their distribution profiles in gradients, their preference for exogenously added acceptor protein and their inhibition and stimulation by suramin and nucleoside, respectively. Suramin-sensitive protein kinase co-purified with the plasma-membrane marker alpha-D-glucosidase and a nucleoside-stimulated protein kinase behaved as a typical cell-sap enzyme. Phosphoprotein phosphatase activity was found to be mainly soluble but a small part seemed to be associated with plasma membranes."
